## IDEAS FOR FUTURE
OCR hand written food/symptom logs (AI?) definatly a paid feature
speech to text logging
Data import (CSV, JSON)




## NEEDS FLESHING OUT NOW
Active flare cards 

Calendar

Hard coded values

In recent entries we should have the cards actually be clickable and popup or something. It's weird to "Use as Template"
