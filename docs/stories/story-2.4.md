# Story 2.4: Correlation Confidence Calculations

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want to see confidence levels on all correlations,
so that I can trust the insights and avoid false-positive triggers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every correlation displays confidence level: High / Medium / Low
2. Confidence calculation uses three factors: sample size, consistency, statistical significance (p < 0.05)
3. High confidence requires: 5+ occurrences, 70%+ consistency, p < 0.05
4. Medium confidence requires: 3-4 occurrences, 50-69% consistency, p < 0.05
5. Low confidence: fewer occurrences or weaker consistency (but still meets minimum threshold)
6. Correlations below statistical significance (p >= 0.05) marked as "Insufficient Data" or hidden from display

    - Medium: Yellow badge (bg-yellow-100, text-yellow-800)
    - Low: Orange badge (bg-orange-100, text-orange-800)
  - [x] Add tooltip showing detailed breakdown: "Sample size: X, Consistency: Y%, p-value: Z"
  - [x] Add accessibility: aria-label with full confidence explanation
  - [x] Create component tests covering rendering, colors, tooltips, accessibility

  - [ ] Test statistical significance filtering (p-value threshold enforcement)
  - [ ] Test consistency calculation edge cases (0%, 100%, partial occurrences)
  - [ ] Validate UI rendering for all confidence levels
  - [ ] Accessibility validation: screen readers announce confidence levels correctly
  - [ ] **Total target: 50+ tests across all modules**

## Dev Notes

- **Confidence Calculation Logic:** Confidence level determined by THREE factors working together:
  1. **Sample Size:** High ≥5 occurrences, Medium 3-4, Low <3 (but still ≥minimum threshold)
  2. **Consistency:** High ≥70%, Medium 50-69%, Low <50%
  3. **Statistical Significance:** p-value < 0.05 required for ANY confidence level (p ≥ 0.05 = "Insufficient Data")
  
- **Multi-Factor Decision Matrix:** Confidence assignment uses the LOWEST factor tier. Examples:
  - Sample=6, Consistency=80%, p=0.02 → **High** (all three factors meet high criteria)
  - Sample=4, Consistency=75%, p=0.03 → **Medium** (sample size limits to medium despite high consistency)
  - Sample=5, Consistency=45%, p=0.04 → **Low** (consistency limits to low despite high sample size)
  - Sample=10, Consistency=85%, p=0.10 → **Insufficient Data** (p-value fails threshold)

- **Consistency Metric:** Calculated as percentage of food occurrences followed by symptom within the correlation time window:
  - Example: User logs "Dairy" 10 times; symptom appears after 7 occurrences within 4-hour window → Consistency = 7/10 = 70%
  - Edge case: If food occurs only once, consistency = 0% or 100% (binary outcome, typically excluded via sample size filter)

- **Statistical Significance:** Reuse existing p-value calculation from Story 2.1 (chi-square test). Correlations with p ≥ 0.05 should be filtered out or marked "Insufficient Data" per NFR003.

- **Confidence Thresholds:** Configurable via service constants for future tuning based on user feedback. Initial values:
  ```typescript
  const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    HIGH_SAMPLE: 5,
    MEDIUM_SAMPLE: 3,
    HIGH_CONSISTENCY: 0.70,
    MEDIUM_CONSISTENCY: 0.50,
    P_VALUE_THRESHOLD: 0.05
  };
  ```

- **Data Model Extension:** `FoodCombinationRecord` interface extends with:
  - `confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"` (required)
  - `consistency: number` (0-1 decimal, required)
  - Both fields indexed for filtering queries

- **UI Integration:** ConfidenceBadge component should be reusable across:
  - FoodCombinationCard (Story 2.3)
  - Future correlation detail views
  - Dashboard summary cards
  
- **Accessibility Requirements:**
  - Confidence badges have aria-label: "High confidence: 5 occurrences, 75% consistency, statistically significant"
  - Tooltips keyboard accessible (focus with Tab, dismiss with Escape)
  - Color coding supplemented with text labels (not color-only)
