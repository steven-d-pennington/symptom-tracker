# Story 2.6: Event Detail Modal for Progressive Disclosure

Status: Ready

## Story

As a user who quick-logged an event,
I want to add additional context later when I have time,
so that I can capture comprehensive data without slowing down initial logging.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Opens when user taps timeline event or taps [Add Details] in quick-log modals
2. Shows event summary at top: type icon, time, name (e.g., "ðŸ’Š Humira at 8:05am")
3. Form fields for additional details based on event type:
   - Medications: Dosage override, detailed notes
   - Symptoms: Severity (1-10), body location, triggers, notes
   - Triggers: Intensity, suspected cause, notes
   - Flares: Already detailed, but can add photos, additional notes
4. Photo attachment: "Add photo" button opens camera/gallery
5. Links to related events: "Link to trigger" suggests recent trigger events
6. Notes field with rich text (bold, lists) via simple markdown
7. [Save] button updates event record with new details
8. [Delete Event] button with confirmation (destructive action)

## Dev Notes

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `src/components/timeline/EventDetailModal.tsx`
- Dynamic form: switch on event.type
- Integrate with existing photoAttachments table
- Use markdown parser for rich text notes

**Photo Integration:**
- Reuse existing photo attachment infrastructure from Phase 2
- Link photos to events via eventId field
- Display thumbnails with full-size preview

**Event Linking:**
- Query all events from same day (24h window)
- Show as suggestions filtered by type
- Store link references in event record

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Progressive disclosure: show only relevant fields per event type
- Rich text notes allow detailed context without complex UI
- Delete confirmation prevents accidental data loss

### Project Structure Notes

**Component Location:**
- Directory: `src/components/timeline/`
- Main component: `EventDetailModal.tsx`

**Dependencies:**
- All event repositories for update/delete operations
- Existing photoAttachments table and components
- Markdown parser library (marked or react-markdown)
- Event linking logic
