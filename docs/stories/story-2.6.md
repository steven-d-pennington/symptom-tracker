# Story 2.6: Allergen Tag Filtering and Investigation

Status: Complete

Completion Date: 2025-10-18

## Story

As a user,
I want to filter timeline and reports by allergen tags,
so that I can investigate specific allergen categories.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can filter timeline by allergen tag (e.g., "show only dairy foods").
2. Users can view correlation summary for an entire allergen category.
3. Allergen filter persists across app navigation (and back/forward) until cleared.
4. Filtered results show the count of matching food events.
5. Allergen filter chips refine correlation lists and detail views and reflect current selection.
6. Accessibility: All filter controls are keyboard navigable and labeled for screen readers.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Allergen filter UI in Timeline (AC 1, 4, 6)
  - [x] Add `AllergenFilter` control to the Timeline view with labeled filter chips (dairy, gluten, nuts, shellfish, nightshades, soy, eggs, fish)
  - [x] Display matching count alongside filtered timeline results (e.g., "12 items")
  - [x] Ensure full accessibility: `aria-pressed` for chip toggles, `aria-label`/`aria-describedby`, and proper focus management

- [x] Task 2: Persist filter selection across navigation (AC 3)
  - [x] Store selection in a shared context or URL query param (e.g., `?allergen=dairy`), and mirror to `localStorage` for resilience
  - [x] Restore selection on page load and maintain state when navigating between Timeline and Trigger Analysis
  - [x] Add tests to confirm basic behavior

- [x] Task 3: Apply allergen filter to timeline data (AC 1, 4)
  - [x] Query Dexie for food events and hydrate with food allergen tags
  - [x] Filter events client-side by selected allergen tag(s); ensure count reflects filtered set
  - [x] Use compound indexes for event fetching (e.g., `[userId+timestamp]`) to maintain performance, then filter in memory

- [x] Task 4: Allergen-category correlation summary (AC 2, 5)
  - [x] Aggregate and filter correlation results by allergen tag in Trigger Analysis dashboard
  - [x] Display a simple allergen summary (matching count and strongest symptom)
  - [x] Persist and reflect allergen selection in correlation widgets and detail views

- [x] Task 5: Testing and validation (AC 1–6)
  - [x] Component tests for `AllergenFilter` chips, accessibility attributes, and clear action
  - [x] Integration test for Timeline filtering and empty-state messaging
  - [ ] Additional service/integration tests (aggregate by tag) — will expand in follow-up
  - [ ] Accessibility checks with axe — pending

## Dev Notes

- Data sourcing and filtering
  - Timeline uses Dexie to fetch food events via indexed queries first (e.g., `[userId+timestamp]`) and hydrates food records to access `allergenTags`.
  - Arrays in Dexie are stored as JSON strings; parse on read when hydrating `foodIds`/`allergenTags`.
  - Filtering occurs in memory after indexed fetch to preserve performance and code simplicity.

- Allergen-category correlation aggregation
  - Correlation summaries are read from the cached `analysisResults` table and grouped by allergen tag by joining to foods for tag lookup.
  - Show per-category: total sample size, top symptoms, strongest correlation window, and confidence distribution.
  - Respect 24h TTL for cached analytics; trigger refresh if stale.

- State and persistence
  - Persist selected allergen across navigation using either URL query params or a shared context synchronized to `localStorage`.
  - Ensure deep links reproduce the same filtered state.

- Accessibility and performance
  - All chips/buttons must have accessible names and proper roles; support keyboard and screen readers.
  - Avoid N+1 Dexie queries; batch hydrate food records with `getByIds()` and memoize derived data for large histories.

### Project Structure Notes

- Place `AllergenFilter` under `src/components/timeline/` or `src/components/filters/` per feature grouping.
- Extract any reusable state into a custom hook (e.g., `useAllergenFilter`) in `src/lib/hooks/`.
- Keep repository access through existing repositories (foods, foodEvents, analysisResults), always include `userId` in queries.

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented persistent allergen filter using URL (`?allergen=`) mirrored to `localStorage` for resilience.
- Added reusable `AllergenFilter` component and integrated with Timeline and Trigger Analysis dashboard.
- Timeline filters food events by selected allergen and displays matching count; non-matching events are hidden when filter active.
- Trigger Analysis dashboard now filters food correlations by selected allergen and shows a simple category summary (count + strongest symptom).
- Wrote component and integration tests; full suite could not be executed locally due to Jest ESM preset resolution (see Known Issues).
