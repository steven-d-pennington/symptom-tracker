# Story 2.1: QuickLog Buttons Component

Status: Ready

## Story

As a user wanting to log an event,
I want to see 4 prominent quick-log buttons on the home screen,
so that I have clear entry points for each event type.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Renders 4 buttons in 2x2 grid: "üî• New Flare", "üíä Medication", "üò£ Symptom", "‚ö†Ô∏è Trigger"
2. Each button displays emoji icon and label text
3. Buttons are visually prominent with appropriate color coding (red for flare, blue for med, etc.)
4. Tap target size ‚â•44px for mobile accessibility
5. Buttons disabled state when modals are open (prevent double-tap)
6. Each button opens its corresponding modal: FlareCreationModal, MedicationLogModal, SymptomLogModal, TriggerLogModal
7. Responsive layout: 2x2 grid on mobile, single row on desktop
8. Loading states while modals initialize

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create QuickLogButtons component (AC: 1,2,3,7)
  - [ ] Set up component file `src/components/quick-log/QuickLogButtons.tsx`
  - [ ] Implement 2x2 grid layout with Tailwind (mobile) and single row (desktop)
  - [ ] Add 4 buttons with emoji icons and labels
  - [ ] Apply color coding: red (flare), blue (medication), yellow (symptom), orange (trigger)

- [ ] Implement modal state management (AC: 5,6)
  - [ ] Add React state to track which modal is open
  - [ ] Pass modal open/close handlers as props
  - [ ] Disable buttons when any modal is open

- [ ] Ensure mobile accessibility (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set minimum tap target size to 44px
  - [ ] Add ARIA labels for screen readers
  - [ ] Test on mobile devices

- [ ] Add loading states (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Show loading indicator while modals initialize
  - [ ] Disable buttons during loading

## Dev Notes

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `src/components/quick-log/QuickLogButtons.tsx`
- Use React state to manage which modal is open
- Follow existing button component patterns from the codebase
- Emoji icons: üî• üíä üò£ ‚ö†Ô∏è (Unicode, no image dependencies)

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Buttons should be large and easy to tap on mobile
- Color coding helps users quickly identify event types
- Disabled state prevents accidental double-taps

**Testing:**
- Test button clicks open correct modals
- Test responsive layout on mobile and desktop
- Test accessibility with screen readers

### Project Structure Notes

- New directory: `src/components/quick-log/`
