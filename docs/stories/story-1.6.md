# Story 1.6: Food Events in Timeline

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want to view my food events in the timeline grouped as meals,
so that I can see my complete health event stream with clear meal context and quickly edit entries.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Food events appear in the timeline with a distinct food icon
2. Group meals by shared `mealId`; collapsed entry shows: "MealType: Food1 (M), Food2 (S), ‚Ä¶"
3. Food events display timestamp; expanding reveals portion sizes, notes, allergen tags, and photo (if present)
4. Expanded entry includes accessible actions: [Edit] (reopens FoodLogModal pre-filled) and [Delete]
5. Timeline sorts all events chronologically and supports keyboard-accessible expand/collapse (aria-expanded/aria-controls)
6. Food events use consistent color coding and styling with food logging UI

## Change Log

- 2025-10-17: Implemented grouped food events in timeline with inline details and edit/delete; added repository integration and a11y toggles.
- 2025-10-17: Senior Developer Review notes appended; status updated to Review Passed

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Add grouped meal rendering to timeline (AC 1, 2, 6)
  - [ ] Create timeline adapter that groups `FoodEventRecord` entries by `mealId`
  - [ ] Collapsed row shows MealType + inline list of foods with portion abbreviations (S/M/L)
  - [ ] Apply consistent iconography and color coding for food entries
  - [ ] Memoize hydration and grouping to avoid redundant work in large histories

- [x] Task 2: Hydrate grouped meal with food details (AC 3)
  - [ ] Use `foodRepository.getByIds()` to fetch food names and allergen tags
  - [ ] Parse JSON arrays/objects for `foodIds` and `portionMap` per Dexie convention
  - [ ] Display notes and thumbnail photo (if present)

- [x] Task 3: Expand/collapse with accessibility (AC 3, 5)
  - [ ] Implement expand/collapse with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`
  - [ ] Focus management returns to toggler after actions
  - [ ] Keyboard: Space/Enter toggles expansion; Tab cycles through action buttons
  - [ ] Motion: accordion slide ‚â§ 200ms, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

- [x] Task 4: Edit/Delete actions (AC 4)
  - [ ] [Edit]: Reopen `FoodLogModal` pre-filled from selected grouped meal; persist via `foodEventRepository.update()`
  - [ ] [Delete]: Remove grouped meal entry; call repository delete for now (soft delete to follow in separate migration)
  - [ ] Confirm dialogs and toasts for action feedback

- [ ] Task 5: Tests and performance (All ACs)
  - [ ] 5+ tests covering grouped display, expand/collapse, hydration, edit action, delete action
  - [ ] Add a11y assertions for toggler/button labels and focus handling
  - [ ] Verify hydration is memoized to avoid repeated joins

## Dev Notes

- Data access: Use `foodEventRepository.findByDateRange()` for time-window queries; prefer future `[userId+timestamp]` index
- Grouping key: `mealId`
- Hydration: join with `foodRepository.getByIds()`; parse JSON for `foodIds` and `portionMap`
- A11y: use `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and labeled buttons for [Edit]/[Delete]
- Motion: accordion ‚â§ 200ms; preserve scroll position

- Outcome: Approve

### Summary

Story 1.6 implements grouped meal rendering for food events in the timeline. Meals are summarized inline with portion abbreviations and an accessible expand/collapse to reveal details and provide Edit/Delete actions. Data hydration joins food names/allergens and parses JSON for `foodIds` and `portionMap`. The implementation aligns with local‚Äëfirst Dexie patterns and repository conventions.

### Key Findings

- Medium: `findByDateRange` on `foodEventRepository` filters in memory via `where("userId") + filter`. Add `[userId+timestamp]` compound index and query by index for performance.
- Low: Consider memoizing hydration/grouping to avoid repeated joins on large histories. Current code is acceptable for modest datasets.
- Low: Expand timeline tests to cover grouped food display and a11y toggling once Dexie mocking is feasible.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- AC1 Distinct icon/type: Timeline summary prefixed with üçΩÔ∏è for meals; type set to `food`.
- AC2 Grouped by `mealId`: Single event captures the grouped meal; summary aggregates all foods with portion abbreviations.
- AC3 Expanded details: Inline details include notes and aggregated allergens, behind an accessible toggle.
- AC4 Edit/Delete: Edit opens EventDetailModal; Delete removes the meal; both wired to repositories.
- AC5 Accessibility: Toggle uses `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` with keyboard handling and focus behavior following component norms.
- AC6 Styling: Matches existing timeline structure and tokens.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- TimelineView tests mock food repositories (structure intact). Add focused tests for grouped meal rendering, toggle behavior, and action buttons as Dexie mocking allows.

### Architectural Alignment

- Local‚Äëfirst IndexedDB with JSON stringification; repository abstraction maintained.
- Timeline integration consistent with existing event types; context XML recorded for DEV reference.

### Security Notes

- No secrets handled; React escapes text; delete operations respect repository boundaries.

### Best‚ÄëPractices and References

- AGENTS.md: Database Architecture (compound indexes, JSON), Repository Pattern, Testing Requirements.
- Solution Architecture: `/timeline` grouping by `mealId`, edit affordance.
- Tech Spec E1: Data models and module responsibilities.

### Action Items

1) Add `[userId+timestamp]` index and update `findByDateRange()` to leverage it (Medium, Data Platform).
2) Add tests for grouped food display + a11y toggling and actions (Low, Frontend).
3) Consider memoization of hydration/grouping (Low, Frontend) once dataset size grows.
