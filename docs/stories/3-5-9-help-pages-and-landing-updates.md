Status: ready-for-dev

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Points:** 8

## Story

As a user (both technical and non-technical),
I want comprehensive help documentation and an engaging landing page,
So that I can quickly learn how to use all features and understand the mission behind the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC3.5.9.1 — Comprehensive Help Pages Created:** Create help section at `/help` with dedicated pages for: Getting Started, Tracking Flares, Logging Data (Food/Symptom/Medication/Trigger), Mood & Sleep Tracking, Body Map Usage, Analytics & Insights, Calendar View, Managing Data, Import/Export, Accessibility Features. Each page should be detailed yet intuitive, with screenshots/examples where helpful, organized with clear headings and navigation, accessible to both technical and non-technical users, include "Related Help Topics" links at bottom.

2. **AC3.5.9.2 — Landing Page Converted to Beta Signup:** Update landing page (/) to focus on beta user recruitment: compelling hero section explaining the mission, key features showcase (Flare Tracking, Body Mapping, Analytics, Mood/Sleep, Offline-First), beta signup form (email input, "Join Beta" button - UI only, no backend yet), testimonial/value proposition section, clear call-to-action throughout, mobile responsive design, professional polish suitable for sharing.

3. **AC3.5.9.3 — About Page Personal Story Added:** Add personal story section at top of About page: authentic narrative about wanting to empower wife to be proactive in treatment, frustration with feeling helpless and unable to make her feel better, realization that providing tools for self-management was something actionable, mission to help others in similar situations, tone should be personal yet professional, concise (3-4 paragraphs max), emotionally resonant without being overly sentimental.

4. **AC3.5.9.4 — Changelog Section Added to About Page:** Add changelog section at bottom of About page: organized by release/epic (Epic 3.5, Epic 3, etc.), each entry shows date and major features/changes, format: "## Version 0.2.0 - Epic 3.5 (October 2025)", bulleted list of key features added, grouped by category (New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes), link to detailed epic documentation if available, reverse chronological order (newest first).

5. **AC3.5.9.5 — Help Navigation and Discoverability:** Help pages easily discoverable: accessible from main navigation menu, search functionality within help section (or clear table of contents), breadcrumb navigation showing current location, "Back to Help" links on all help pages, help icon/link in page headers where contextually relevant (e.g., "Help" link on food logging page points to food logging help), keyboard shortcut (?) already links to keyboard shortcuts help.

6. **AC3.5.9.6 — Help Content Quality:** All help content meets quality standards: written in clear, simple language, assumes no prior knowledge, includes practical examples and use cases, addresses common questions/issues, includes helpful tips and best practices, screenshots/diagrams where visual aid helps, consistent formatting and style across all pages, tested with both technical and non-technical readers.

7. **AC3.5.9.7 — Landing Page Call-to-Action Effectiveness:** Landing page optimized for conversion: clear value proposition above the fold, prominent beta signup form (visible without scrolling), compelling reason to join beta, trust signals (privacy-first, offline-first, etc.), professional design that builds credibility, mobile-first responsive design, fast load time (no heavy images/assets).

8. **AC3.5.9.8 — Content Consistency and Brand Voice:** All new content maintains consistent brand voice: empowering and supportive tone, patient-centric language, technically accurate but accessible, respectful of users' health challenges, emphasizes privacy and user control, mission-driven messaging, professional yet approachable, avoids medical advice/claims.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

- **Help Section Strategy:** Comprehensive help documentation is essential for production launch. Users need self-service resources to learn features without support tickets.
- **Landing Page Pivot:** Moving from "developer landing page" to "beta recruitment page" prepares for public launch. UI-only signup form allows testing conversion without backend complexity.
- **Personal Story Impact:** Authentic founder story builds trust and emotional connection. Users need to understand the "why" behind the product.
- **Changelog Importance:** Transparent communication of product evolution builds user confidence and sets expectations for future development.

### Implementation Guidance

**Help Hub Structure:**
```typescript
// src/app/(protected)/help/page.tsx
export default function HelpPage() {
  const helpTopics = [
    {
      category: "Getting Started",
      topics: [
        { title: "Welcome to Symptom Tracker", href: "/help/getting-started" },
        { title: "Your First Week", href: "/help/first-week" },
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "Tracking Features",
      topics: [
        { title: "Tracking Flares", href: "/help/tracking-flares" },
        { title: "Logging Food", href: "/help/logging-food" },
        { title: "Logging Symptoms", href: "/help/logging-symptoms" },
        // etc.
      ]
    },
    // More categories...
  ];

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <h1>Help Center</h1>
      {helpTopics.map(category => (
        <section key={category.category}>
          <h2>{category.category}</h2>
          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {category.topics.map(topic => (
              <HelpTopicCard key={topic.href} {...topic} />
            ))}
          </div>
        </section>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Landing Page Beta Signup:**
```typescript

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function LandingPage() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

  const handleSignup = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // TODO: Wire up backend later

**About Page Personal Story:**
```markdown
## Our Story

When my wife was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune condition, I felt utterly helpless. I couldn't make her pain go away. I couldn't cure her illness. I couldn't even predict when the next flare would strike.

But what I *could* do was give her tools to take control of her own health journey. I realized that while I couldn't fix the problem, I could empower her to be proactive in her treatment and management. I could help her track patterns, communicate better with her doctors, and feel less like a passive victim of her condition.

That's why I built Pocket Symptom Tracker. Not as a cure, but as a companion. A way for people living with chronic conditions to gather their own data, understand their own patterns, and advocate for themselves with confidence.

If you or someone you love is on a similar journey, I hope this tool helps you feel a little more empowered, a little more in control, and a little less alone.

— Steven Pennington, Creator
