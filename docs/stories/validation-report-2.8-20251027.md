#### ✓ PASS - Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
**Evidence:** Lines 13-15
```xml
<asA>user reviewing past flares</asA>
<iWant>to access a list of all resolved flares</iWant>
<soThat>I can review historical patterns and outcomes</soThat>
```
All three user story fields properly captured from source story.

**Evidence:** Lines 59-116, 7 criteria (AC2.8.1 through AC2.8.7)
All acceptance criteria accurately transcribed from story-2.8.md without invention. Includes:
- AC2.8.1: Resolved Flares page displays filtered list
- AC2.8.2: Each card shows comprehensive information
- AC2.8.3: List sorted by resolution date
- AC2.8.4: Navigation to read-only detail view

- AC2.8.6: Empty state guidance
- AC2.8.7: Resolved flares count badge

#### ✓ PASS - Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
**Evidence:** Lines 16-56, 7 tasks mapped to ACs
Tasks properly extracted and mapped to acceptance criteria:
- Task 1 → AC2.8.2 (ResolvedFlareCard component)
- Task 2 → AC2.8.1, AC2.8.3 (Resolved Flares page)
- Task 3 → AC2.8.5 (Filtering UI)
- Task 4 → AC2.8.6 (Empty state)
- Task 5 → AC2.8.7 (Count badge)
- Task 6 → AC2.8.4 (Navigation)
- Task 7 → All ACs (Comprehensive tests)

#### ✓ PASS - Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
**Evidence:** Lines 119-192, 12 documentation artifacts
Excellent documentation coverage including:
- PRD.md: FR009, FR011, FR012, NFR001, NFR002
- epics.md: Story 2.8 specification
- solution-architecture.md: Epic 2 component structure
- Related stories: 0.2, 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.7
All snippets are concise (2-3 sentences) and accurately extracted.

#### ✓ PASS - Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
**Evidence:** Lines 193-257, 9 code artifacts
Comprehensive code artifact coverage:
- useFlares hook (lines 1-50)
- flareRepository methods: getResolvedFlares, getFlareHistory
- Type definitions: FlareRecord, FlareEventRecord, FlareStatus
- Reference components: ActiveFlareCard, ActiveFlaresEmptyState
- Data sources: bodyRegions
- Page components: FlareDetailPage, ActiveFlaresPage

Each artifact includes path, kind, symbol, line hints, and clear reason for relevance.

#### ✓ PASS - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
**Evidence:** Lines 293-343, 7 interfaces documented
All critical interfaces identified with full signatures:
- Repository methods: getResolvedFlares(), getFlareHistory()
- React hooks: useFlares()
- Type interfaces: FlareRecord, FlareEventRecord
- Navigation: Next.js Router
- Data structures: Body Regions array

#### ✓ PASS - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
**Evidence:** Lines 281-292, 10 constraints
Comprehensive constraints covering:
- Offline-First Architecture (NFR002)
- Performance requirements (NFR001: 44px touch targets, <100ms)
- Pattern consistency (match ActiveFlareCard styling)
- Empty state patterns (Story 0.2)
- Read-only navigation (Story 2.7)
- Sort and filter persistence (localStorage, URL params)
- Accessibility requirements
- Data immutability
- Duration calculation formula

#### ✓ PASS - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
**Evidence:** Lines 258-278, Node.js ecosystem detected
All relevant dependencies identified from package.json:
- **Production:** next (15.5.4), react (19.1.0), date-fns (^4.1.0), dexie (^4.2.0), lucide-react (^0.544.0), uuid (^13.0.0), zod (^4.1.12)

Each package includes version and usage description.

#### ✓ PASS - Testing standards and locations populated
**Evidence:** Lines 344-433
Complete testing section with:
- **Standards:** Jest + @testing-library/react patterns, mocking strategies, AAA pattern, AC coverage target
- **Locations:** 4 test file paths specified
- **Test Ideas:** Comprehensive test scenarios for all 7 ACs plus accessibility tests

Test ideas properly mapped to acceptance criteria with specific test cases (35+ test scenarios).

#### ✓ PASS - XML structure follows story-context template format
**Evidence:** Lines 1-435, complete XML document
Valid XML structure matching template:
- metadata section (lines 2-10)
- story section with asA/iWant/soThat/tasks (lines 12-57)
- acceptanceCriteria section (lines 59-116)
- artifacts with docs/code/dependencies (lines 118-279)
