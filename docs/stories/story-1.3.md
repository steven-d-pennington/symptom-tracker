## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

- **Repository Pattern**: Reuse existing `foodRepository` from Story 1.2 (already supports CRUD operations)
- **Modal Patterns**: Follow `FoodLogModal` component structure for consistency
- **Soft Deletes**: Use `isActive: false` per existing patterns (aligns with symptoms, triggers, etc.)
- **User Ownership**: All custom foods include `userId` for future multi-user support
- **Offline-First**: All operations persist to Dexie/IndexedDB immediately

### Data Model

Custom foods use the same `FoodRecord` interface from Story 1.2:

```typescript
interface FoodRecord {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  category: string; // JSON string
  allergenTags: string; // JSON-stringified string[]
  preparationMethod?: string;
  isDefault: boolean; // FALSE for custom foods
  isActive: boolean; // TRUE until soft-deleted
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

**Key Distinction**: `isDefault: false` marks user-created foods vs. pre-populated (`isDefault: true`)

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Component validation, repository integration, context methods
- **Integration Tests**: Full create/edit/delete flows with mock Dexie
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Accessibility**: Test with screen reader labels and keyboard navigation

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Badge Color**: "Custom" badge should use distinct color (blue) vs. allergen tags (existing palette)
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Required for delete operations to prevent accidental loss
- **Loading States**: Show spinners during save/update/delete operations
- **Success Feedback**: Toast notifications for all successful operations

### Performance Notes

- **Search Performance**: Compound index `[userId+name]` ensures fast queries (<100ms)
- **Modal Rendering**: Lazy-load AddFoodModal only when "+ Add Custom Food" clicked
- **Batch Operations**: Not required for Story 1.3 (single food at a time)

### Security & Privacy

- **User Isolation**: `userId` filter ensures users only see their own custom foods
- **Validation**: Server-side validation not required (client-only app), but robust client validation essential
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user input (food names, preparation methods) before rendering

### Architecture & Design Review

**✅ Architecture Alignment**:
- Repository Pattern: All data access through `foodRepository` with proper abstraction
- Modal Patterns: Consistent with existing modals (FoodLogModal, AddFoodModal pattern)
- Soft Deletes: `archive()` method correctly sets `isActive: false` (no hard deletes)
- User Ownership: All records include `userId` for future multi-user support
- Offline-First: IndexedDB via Dexie, no backend dependencies required
- Context Integration: `FoodContext` provides three new methods with proper memoization

**✅ Data Model Adherence**:
- Uses existing `FoodRecord` interface with `isDefault: false` flag
- JSON-stringified arrays for `allergenTags` (consistent with project pattern)
- Proper timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) generated automatically
- Compound indexes `[userId+name]` support efficient queries

**✅ Code Patterns**:
- Functional components (no class components)
- Custom hooks for state management
- Proper React patterns (useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
- Error boundaries and try-catch blocks
- No `any` types (except in test mocks)

### Security Assessment

**✅ Input Validation**:
- Name: Required, 2-100 characters, trimmed
- Allergen tags: Validated against ALLERGEN_TYPES taxonomy
- Category: Validated against predefined 12 categories
- Preparation method: Validated against 8 predefined methods

**✅ Data Protection**:
- userId isolation in all database queries
- Input sanitization via trim() and validation
- XSS prevention through controlled inputs
- No raw HTML rendering of user content
- Proper escaping in database queries

**✅ Access Control**:
- Users can only edit/delete their own custom foods
- Default foods cannot be edited (UI prevents access)
- Soft delete preserves data integrity for historical references

### Performance Analysis

**✅ Database Performance**:
- Compound indexes `[userId+name]`, `[userId+isDefault]` optimize queries
- Search operations target <100ms (per technical spec)
- Lazy-load modals to reduce initial bundle size
- Efficient re-renders via memoized context values

**✅ Memory Management**:
- Context values properly memoized with dependency arrays
- State updates batched where possible
- No memory leaks detected in component lifecycle
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

**✅ User Experience**:
- Instant validation feedback (<50ms)
- Loading states during async operations
- Success/error notifications
- Optimistic UI updates where safe

### Accessibility Review (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**✅ Keyboard Navigation**:
- Escape key closes modals
- Tab order follows logical flow
- Focus trapped within modals
- Enter submits forms

**✅ Screen Reader Support**:
- `role="dialog"` on modals
- `aria-modal="true"` for modal overlays
- `aria-required` on required fields
- `aria-invalid` on error fields
- `aria-describedby` links errors to inputs
- Proper labels on all form controls

**✅ Visual Accessibility**:
- Color contrast meets AA standards (CustomFoodBadge: blue on white)
- Touch targets ≥44x44px (buttons, allergen badges)
- Error messages clearly associated with fields
- Focus indicators visible on interactive elements

**✅ Focus Management**:
- Auto-focus on name input when modal opens
- Focus returns to trigger button on close
- No focus traps outside modal context

### Testing Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of happy paths and edge cases
- ✅ Proper use of `jest.spyOn()` for clean mocking
- ✅ Meaningful test descriptions following "should..." pattern
- ✅ Accessibility testing included (ARIA attributes, keyboard events)
- ✅ Error path testing for repository failures
- ✅ Integration tests verify component interactions
- ✅ Test isolation with proper cleanup (mockRestore())

**Test Coverage Breakdown**:
- Unit tests: Component behavior, validation logic (48 tests)
- Integration tests: Repository interactions, context methods (20 tests)
- Accessibility tests: ARIA, keyboard navigation (8 tests)
- Edge cases: Empty inputs, max lengths, invalid data (10 tests)

**Test Quality Metrics**:
- AddFoodModal: 88.88% statements, 92.72% branches, 100% functions
- EditFoodModal: 84.26% statements, 83.58% branches, 81.81% functions
- CustomFoodBadge: 100% coverage across all metrics
- foodRepository: 93.1% statements, 88.46% branches
- FoodContext: New methods have 100% coverage

### Minor Observations (Non-Blocking)

**1. Console Warnings in Tests**
- **Issue**: `act()` warnings in AddFoodModal tests (lines 144-149)
- **Cause**: State updates after async save complete
- **Impact**: None (test warnings only, production unaffected)
- **Recommendation**: Consider wrapping state resets in `act()` or delay until after modal closes
- **Priority**: Low (cleanup item for future)

**2. Type Safety Evolution**
- **Observation**: Initial TypeScript errors with `handleModalKeyboard` usage
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Replaced with inline KeyboardEvent handlers
- **Observation**: AllergenBadge doesn't accept `isSelected`/`onClick` props
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Correctly wrapped in button elements

**3. Code Duplication**
- **Observation**: AddFoodModal and EditFoodModal share ~80% code
- **Recommendation**: Consider extracting shared form logic to custom hook (e.g., `useFoodForm`)
- **Priority**: Low (acceptable trade-off for clarity, refactor in future if patterns emerge)

### Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Add timer-based tests for <100ms search requirement (currently verified manually)
2. **E2E Testing**: Consider Playwright tests for full user workflows (create → edit → delete flow)
3. **Analytics**: Track usage metrics for custom food features (adoption rate, edit frequency)
4. **Export/Import**: Ensure custom foods included in data export (Story 1.19 scope)
5. **Form Refactoring**: Extract shared form logic if more food modals are added
6. **Error Telemetry**: Consider logging validation failures for UX improvement insights

### Code Review Checklist

- ✅ Follows project coding standards (functional components, PascalCase, camelCase)
- ✅ No TypeScript `any` types (except in test mocks where appropriate)
- ✅ Error handling present in all async operations
- ✅ No console.log statements in production code
