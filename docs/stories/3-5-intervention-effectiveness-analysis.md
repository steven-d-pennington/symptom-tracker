# Story 3.5: Intervention Effectiveness Analysis

Status: done

## Story

As a user trying different treatments,
I want to see which interventions correlate with flare improvement,
So that I can identify effective treatments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC3.5.1 — Analytics page displays Intervention Effectiveness section:** Add "Intervention Effectiveness" section to existing `/flares/analytics` page (from Stories 3.1, 3.3, 3.4), section appears below Flare Trends section, section header includes title and uses same time range selector state, follows responsive layout patterns from previous stories, prominent medical disclaimer displayed at top of section. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]

2. **AC3.5.2 — Intervention metrics display for each type:** Display effectiveness metrics calculated from analyticsRepository.getInterventionEffectiveness(userId, timeRange) for each intervention type (Ice, Heat, Medication, Rest, Drainage, Other): (1) usage count (total times intervention used in time range), (2) average severity change after intervention (calculated as severity 48h after - severity at intervention, positive = improvement, rounded to 1 decimal), (3) success rate (percentage of times severity decreased within 48 hours of intervention, rounded to 1 decimal). Each intervention type displayed as card with icon, metrics, and color coding based on effectiveness. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]

3. **AC3.5.3 — Interventions ranked by effectiveness:** Interventions sorted by success rate (descending, most effective first), secondary sort by usage count if success rates equal, ranking displayed with visual indicators (1st, 2nd, 3rd badges), interventions with insufficient data (< 5 instances) shown separately in "Insufficient Data" section with usage count, ranking only applies to interventions meeting minimum threshold. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]

4. **AC3.5.4 — Medical disclaimer and correlation caveat:** Prominent disclaimer message displayed at top of Intervention Effectiveness section: "⚠️ Important: This analysis shows correlation, not causation. Multiple factors affect flare progression. Always discuss treatment decisions with your healthcare provider." Message styled with warning icon, yellow/amber background, clear typography, positioned before intervention cards. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]

5. **AC3.5.5 — Time range selector integration:** Intervention Effectiveness section shares time range state with Problem Areas, Progression Metrics, and Flare Trends sections (Stories 3.1, 3.3, 3.4), changing time range triggers recalculation of intervention metrics for new range, uses same useAnalytics hook pattern with 10-second polling, loading skeleton shown during recalculation, smooth transitions when data updates. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5] [Source: docs/stories/story-3.3.md]

6. **AC3.5.6 — Minimum data threshold enforcement:** Intervention types with fewer than 5 instances in selected time range excluded from ranked effectiveness list, insufficient interventions shown in separate "Insufficient Data" section below ranked list, section displays intervention type and current count (e.g., "Heat: 2 uses - need 3 more for analysis"), empty state shown if no interventions meet minimum threshold with message "Log at least 5 interventions for effectiveness analysis". [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]

7. **AC3.5.7 — Drill-down to intervention instances:** Each intervention card includes "View Details" button or link, clicking opens InterventionDetailModal showing: (1) list of all intervention instances with timestamps, associated flare ID, and outcome (severity change 48h later), (2) flare link to navigate to flare detail view, (3) chart showing severity before/after intervention for each instance, modal dismissable with close button or backdrop click, accessible via keyboard (Escape key closes).

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

- **Epic 3 Completion:** Story 3.5 completes Epic 3 (Flare Analytics and Problem Areas) by adding intervention effectiveness analysis. This builds on Stories 3.1 (Problem Areas), 3.2 (Per-Region History), 3.3 (Duration/Severity Metrics), and 3.4 (Trend Analysis). [Source: docs/epics.md#Epic-3]
- **Data Foundation:** Leverages intervention data from Epic 2, specifically Story 2.5 (Log Flare Interventions) where FlareEvent records with eventType='intervention' are created containing intervention type and details. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-2.5]
- **48-Hour Analysis Window:** Effectiveness is measured by comparing severity at intervention time to severity 48 hours later, following medical best practices for tracking short-term treatment response. Missing 48h data (no status update within 24-72h window) excludes intervention from success rate calculation but includes in usage count. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]
- **Analytics Extension:** Extends analyticsRepository from Stories 3.1-3.4 with new method getInterventionEffectiveness, maintaining separation of concerns and consistent patterns. [Source: docs/solution-architecture.md#Repository-Architecture]
- **Shared Time Range State:** Intervention Effectiveness section shares time range state with all other analytics sections (Problem Areas, Progression Metrics, Flare Trends), ensuring consistent time filtering across entire analytics dashboard. [Source: docs/stories/story-3.3.md]
- **Medical Disclaimer Requirement:** Prominent caveat message required by acceptance criteria to prevent users from drawing causal conclusions from correlation analysis. Emphasizes importance of consulting healthcare providers for treatment decisions. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5] [Source: docs/PRD.md#FR012]
- **Minimum Data Threshold:** 5 instances per intervention type required before showing effectiveness metrics, preventing misleading statistics from small sample sizes. Insufficient interventions shown separately to encourage continued tracking. [Source: docs/epics.md#Story-3.5]
- **Offline-First Architecture:** All effectiveness calculations use Dexie queries on IndexedDB following NFR002, no network dependency, consistent with existing patterns. [Source: docs/PRD.md#NFR002]

### Implementation Guidance

**1. Intervention effectiveness calculation algorithm:**

```typescript
// src/lib/repositories/analyticsRepository.ts (extend existing)
import { InterventionType, InterventionEffectiveness, InterventionInstance } from '@/types/analytics';

export const analyticsRepository = {
  // ... existing methods from Stories 3.1-3.4 ...

  async getInterventionEffectiveness(
    userId: string,
    timeRange: TimeRange
  ): Promise<InterventionEffectiveness[]> {
    // Fetch all flares within time range
    const allFlares = await db.flares.where({ userId }).toArray();
    const flaresInRange = allFlares.filter(f => withinTimeRange(f, timeRange));

    // Collect all intervention events from these flares
    const interventionMap = new Map<InterventionType, InterventionInstance[]>();

    for (const flare of flaresInRange) {
      // Get all events for this flare, sorted by timestamp
      const events = await db.flareEvents
        .where({ flareId: flare.id })
        .sortBy('timestamp');

      // Find intervention events
      const interventionEvents = events.filter(e => e.eventType === 'intervention');

      for (const interventionEvent of interventionEvents) {
        // Parse intervention type from event details
        const interventionType = this.parseInterventionType(interventionEvent.details);

        // Find severity at intervention time (most recent status_update before or at intervention)
        const priorStatusUpdates = events.filter(
          e => e.eventType === 'status_update' &&
               e.timestamp <= interventionEvent.timestamp &&
               e.severity !== undefined
        );
        const severityAtIntervention = priorStatusUpdates.length > 0
          ? priorStatusUpdates[priorStatusUpdates.length - 1].severity!
          : flare.initialSeverity || 0;

        // Find severity 48 hours after intervention (24-72h window)
        const after48hTimestamp = interventionEvent.timestamp + (48 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        const windowStart = interventionEvent.timestamp + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        const windowEnd = interventionEvent.timestamp + (72 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

        const followUpUpdates = events.filter(
          e => e.eventType === 'status_update' &&
               e.timestamp >= windowStart &&
               e.timestamp <= windowEnd &&
               e.severity !== undefined
        ).sort((a, b) => Math.abs(a.timestamp - after48hTimestamp) - Math.abs(b.timestamp - after48hTimestamp));

        const severityAfter48h = followUpUpdates.length > 0 ? followUpUpdates[0].severity! : null;
        const severityChange = severityAfter48h !== null
          ? severityAtIntervention - severityAfter48h  // Positive = improvement
          : null;

        // Create intervention instance
        const instance: InterventionInstance = {
          id: interventionEvent.id,
          flareId: flare.id,
          interventionType,
          timestamp: interventionEvent.timestamp,
          severityAtIntervention,
          severityAfter48h,
          severityChange
        };

        // Add to map
        if (!interventionMap.has(interventionType)) {
          interventionMap.set(interventionType, []);
        }
        interventionMap.get(interventionType)!.push(instance);
      }
    }

    // Calculate effectiveness metrics for each intervention type
    const effectivenessResults: InterventionEffectiveness[] = [];

    for (const [interventionType, instances] of interventionMap.entries()) {
      const usageCount = instances.length;

      // Calculate average severity change (only instances with 48h data)
      const instancesWithFollowup = instances.filter(i => i.severityChange !== null);
      const averageSeverityChange = instancesWithFollowup.length > 0
        ? instancesWithFollowup.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.severityChange!, 0) / instancesWithFollowup.length
        : null;

      // Calculate success rate (% with positive severity change)
      const successCount = instancesWithFollowup.filter(i => i.severityChange! > 0).length;
      const successRate = instancesWithFollowup.length > 0
        ? (successCount / instancesWithFollowup.length) * 100
        : null;

      effectivenessResults.push({
        interventionType,
        usageCount,
        averageSeverityChange: averageSeverityChange !== null
          ? Math.round(averageSeverityChange * 10) / 10
          : null,
        successRate: successRate !== null
          ? Math.round(successRate * 10) / 10
          : null,
        hasSufficientData: usageCount >= 5,
        instances
      });
    }

    // Sort by success rate (descending), then usage count
    effectivenessResults.sort((a, b) => {
      if (a.successRate === null && b.successRate === null) {
        return b.usageCount - a.usageCount;
      }
      if (a.successRate === null) return 1;
      if (b.successRate === null) return -1;
      if (Math.abs(a.successRate - b.successRate) > 0.1) {
        return b.successRate - a.successRate;
      }
      return b.usageCount - a.usageCount;
    });

    return effectivenessResults;
  },

  private parseInterventionType(details: string): InterventionType {
    const lowerDetails = details.toLowerCase();
    if (lowerDetails.includes('ice')) return 'Ice';

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files to Create:**
- Update `src/types/analytics.ts` - Add InterventionType enum, InterventionInstance, InterventionEffectiveness interfaces
- Extend `src/lib/repositories/analyticsRepository.ts` - Add getInterventionEffectiveness method
- Update `src/lib/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` - Extend hook to return interventionEffectiveness
- Create `src/components/analytics/InterventionEffectivenessCard.tsx` - Individual intervention card
- Create `src/components/analytics/InsufficientDataCard.tsx` - Card for interventions with < 5 uses
- Create `src/components/analytics/InterventionDetailModal.tsx` - Modal showing intervention instances
- Create `src/components/analytics/MedicalDisclaimerBanner.tsx` - Warning banner component
- Create `src/components/analytics/InterventionEffectivenessSection.tsx` - Main section component
- Update `src/app/(protected)/flares/analytics/page.tsx` - Add InterventionEffectivenessSection to analytics page

**Existing Dependencies:**
- `src/lib/db/database.ts` (Dexie instance) ✅
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` (FlareRecord, FlareEventRecord interfaces) ✅
- `src/lib/repositories/analyticsRepository.ts` (from Stories 3.1-3.4) ✅
- `src/lib/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` (from Stories 3.1, 3.3, 3.4) ✅
- `src/lib/utils/timeRange.ts` (from Story 3.1) ✅
- Chart.js and chartjs-plugin-annotation (per solution-architecture.md) ✅
- lucide-react icons (existing dependency) ✅

**Alignment with Solution Architecture:**
- Extends analyticsRepository pattern from Stories 3.1-3.4
- Follows hook pattern from Epic 2 and Stories 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 (useAnalytics extension)
- Maintains offline-first architecture: Components → Hook → Repository → Dexie → IndexedDB
- Uses Chart.js for before/after severity visualization in detail modal
- Follows component architecture: InterventionEffectivenessSection → Cards → Modal
- Shares time range state with all other analytics sections

### Data & State Considerations

- **Intervention Type Parsing:** Parse intervention type from FlareEvent.details field using keyword matching (ice, heat, medication, rest, drainage, other). Consider creating enum or type field in future schema updates.
- **48-Hour Window:** Use 24-72 hour window (centered on 48h) to find closest status update after intervention. If no update in window, severityAfter48h is null.
- **Severity Change Calculation:** severityAtIntervention - severityAfter48h (positive = improvement, negative = worsening). Use most recent status_update before or at intervention time for baseline severity.
- **Success Rate Definition:** Percentage of interventions where severityChange > 0 (any improvement). Only count interventions with 48h follow-up data in success rate denominator.
- **Average Severity Change:** Mean of all severityChange values for interventions with 48h data. Positive values indicate improvement on average.
- **Ranking Logic:** Sort by successRate descending, then usageCount descending. Null success rates (no 48h data) sorted to end.
- **Minimum Threshold:** 5 instances required for "sufficient data" flag. Display interventions with < 5 instances separately with encouragement to continue tracking.
- **Color Coding:** Success rate > 60% green, 40-60% yellow, < 40% red. Mirrors severity color scheme from Story 3.3.
- **Shared State:** Time range state shared with Problem Areas, Progression Metrics, and Flare Trends sections.
- **Loading State:** Show skeleton placeholders during initial fetch and refetch.
- **Empty State:** Show when no interventions in time range, encourage users to log interventions.

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- analyticsRepository.getInterventionEffectiveness: empty data, single type, multiple types, edge cases
- Severity change calculation: improvement, worsening, no change, missing 48h data
- Success rate calculation: various outcomes, null handling
- Minimum threshold logic: exactly 5, < 5, > 5 uses
- Time range filtering: interventions within/outside range
- Sorting: by success rate, by usage count, nulls last

**Integration Tests:**
- InterventionEffectivenessSection: empty state, loading state, ranked list, insufficient data section
- Card components: rendering, metrics display, click handlers
- Modal: open/close, instance list, chart rendering, flare links, keyboard interaction
- Shared state: time range changes affect all analytics sections including intervention effectiveness

**Accessibility Tests:**
- Keyboard navigation through intervention cards (Tab, Enter)
- Modal keyboard controls (Escape to close, Tab trapping)
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility for metric values and disclaimer
- Focus indicators visible and clear
- Disclaimer banner announced by screen readers (role="alert")

### Performance Considerations

- **Query Performance:** Dexie indexed queries on userId and flareId are O(log n), acceptable for <1000 flares and <5000 events
- **Calculation Overhead:** Intervention analysis is O(n*m) where n=flares, m=avg events per flare. Nested loops for 48h window search. Consider optimization if performance issues arise (e.g., pre-index events by timestamp).
- **Parallel Fetching:** Fetch intervention effectiveness in parallel with other analytics using Promise.all
- **Modal Rendering:** Lazy render modal content only when opened (not on initial page load)
- **Chart in Modal:** Use Chart.js with lightweight configuration, render on modal open
- **Memoization:** Consider useMemo for intervention grouping/sorting if re-render frequency high
- **Loading Skeleton:** Show skeleton placeholders during fetch to indicate loading state
- **Polling Pattern:** Maintain 10-second polling from Stories 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 for reactive updates

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary (2025-10-29)**

Story 3.5 implementation completed successfully. All 9 tasks and 151 subtasks implemented and tested.

**Key Components Created:**
1. **Analytics Repository Extension** - Added getInterventionEffectiveness method to analyticsRepository with 48-hour window logic for measuring treatment efficacy
2. **Data Types** - Defined InterventionType, InterventionInstance, and InterventionEffectiveness interfaces in analytics types
3. **Hook Integration** - Extended useAnalytics hook to fetch intervention data in parallel with other metrics
4. **UI Components** - Created 5 new components: InterventionEffectivenessCard, InsufficientDataCard, InterventionDetailModal, MedicalDisclaimerBanner, and InterventionEffectivenessSection
5. **Analytics Page** - Integrated Intervention Effectiveness section into analytics dashboard below Flare Trends
6. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive tests added for repository methods and components

**Implementation Highlights:**
- 48-hour effectiveness window with 24-72h tolerance for finding follow-up severity data
- Minimum threshold of 5 instances enforced for reliable statistics
- Ranking system based on success rate (descending) with secondary sort by usage count
- Medical disclaimer prominently displayed emphasizing correlation vs. causation
- Drill-down modal with Chart.js bar chart showing before/after severity for each intervention instance
- Full accessibility support: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements
- Responsive grid layout for intervention cards (1/2/3 columns based on screen size)
- Color-coded success rates: green (>60%), yellow (40-60%), red (<40%)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used capitalized intervention types (Ice, Heat, etc.) in analytics domain, mapping from lowercase database values
- Chose Bar chart over Line chart for intervention detail view to clearly show individual before/after comparisons
- Implemented focus trapping and Escape key handling in modal for accessibility
- Followed existing patterns from Stories 3.1-3.4 for consistency

All acceptance criteria met. Ready for review.
