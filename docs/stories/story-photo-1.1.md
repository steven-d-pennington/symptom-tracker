# Story Photo-1.1: Basic Drawing Shapes for Photo Annotation

Status: Ready for Development

## Story

As a **user managing autoimmune symptoms**,
I want **to draw shapes (arrows, circles, rectangles) on my medical photos**,
so that **I can highlight specific symptom areas for my doctor to review during appointments**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **PhotoAnnotation Component Rendering** - PhotoAnnotation component renders in fullscreen modal when user taps "Annotate" button in PhotoViewer
   - Modal displays photo at full size with canvas overlay
   - Drawing tools panel visible (arrow, circle, rectangle buttons)
   - Color picker and line width controls visible
   - Save/Cancel action buttons visible

2. **Arrow Tool** - Arrow tool draws directional arrows with configurable line width
   - User can tap/click arrow button to select tool
   - Arrow button shows active state when selected
   - User can draw arrow by dragging from start point to end point
   - Arrow appears immediately as user drags (real-time preview)
   - Arrow has arrowhead pointing in drag direction
   - Line width selector affects arrow thickness (thin/medium/thick)

3. **Circle Tool** - Circle tool draws circles around areas of concern
   - User can tap/click circle button to select tool
   - Circle button shows active state when selected
   - User can draw circle by dragging from center to edge
   - Circle radius expands as user drags (real-time preview)
   - Circle outline matches selected line width

4. **Rectangle Tool** - Rectangle tool draws rectangles to frame regions
   - User can tap/click rectangle button to select tool
   - Rectangle button shows active state when selected
   - User can draw rectangle by dragging from corner to opposite corner
   - Rectangle expands as user drags (real-time preview)
   - Rectangle outline matches selected line width

5. **Color Picker** - Color picker supports medical-appropriate colors
   - Red, blue, yellow, green color options available
   - Selected color applies to current and future annotations
   - Color swatches clearly show which color is active
   - Color persists when switching between tools

6. **Line Width Selector** - Line width selector supports three thickness options
   - Thin (1-2px), medium (3-4px), thick (5-6px) options available
   - Selected width applies to current and future shapes
   - Width preview visible in selector UI
   - Width persists when switching between tools

7. **Touch Input Support** - Canvas supports touch input on mobile devices
   - Single-finger touch draws shapes
   - Touch events feel responsive (<16ms frame time)
   - Pinch-to-zoom disabled while drawing tool active
   - Touch targets for buttons are 44x44px minimum (WCAG)

8. **Mouse Input Support** - Canvas supports mouse input on desktop
   - Left mouse button draws shapes
   - Mouse cursor changes based on selected tool
   - Hover preview shows where annotation will start
   - Smooth drawing performance at 60fps

9. **Real-Time Performance** - Drawing performance feels real-time
   - Shape preview renders within 16ms of pointer move
   - No lag or stuttering during drawing
   - Canvas clears and redraws efficiently
   - Memory usage remains stable during extended annotation session

10. **Multiple Shapes** - Multiple shapes can be added to same photo
    - User can add unlimited shapes (arrows, circles, rectangles)
    - Each shape is independently rendered
    - Shapes can overlap without interference
    - Order of shapes preserved (z-index by creation time)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Component Architecture:**
- PhotoAnnotation is a fullscreen modal component (extends PhotoViewer)
- Uses HTML5 Canvas API exclusively (no SVG or third-party libraries)
- Follows non-destructive editing pattern (annotations as overlays, original photo unchanged)
- Implements Pointer Events API for unified touch/mouse/stylus handling

**State Management:**
```typescript
// Local component state (React useState)
annotations: PhotoAnnotation[]       // Array of completed annotations
selectedTool: AnnotationTool         // Current tool ('arrow' | 'circle' | 'rectangle')
toolConfig: ToolConfig              // { color, lineWidth, fontSize, blurIntensity }
history: PhotoAnnotation[][]        // Undo stack (max 10 states)
historyIndex: number                // Current position in history
isDrawing: boolean                  // Drawing in progress flag
currentAnnotation: PhotoAnnotation  // Annotation being drawn (preview)
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Drawing operations must execute in <16ms (60fps target)
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth rendering
- Debounce pointermove events if necessary (max 60 events/second)
- Clear and redraw entire canvas on each frame (simple, fast)

**Data Model:**
```typescript
interface PhotoAnnotation {
  id: string;                        // UUID
  type: 'arrow' | 'circle' | 'rectangle';
  color: string;                     // Hex color code
  lineWidth: number;                 // 2 | 4 | 6
  coordinates: AnnotationCoordinates;
  createdAt: Date;
  order: number;                     // Z-index for layering
}

interface AnnotationCoordinates {
  // Arrow
  startX?: number; startY?: number; endX?: number; endY?: number;
  // Circle
  centerX?: number; centerY?: number; radius?: number;
  // Rectangle
  x?: number; y?: number; width?: number; height?: number;
}
```

**Coordinates Strategy:**
- Store coordinates as **percentages** (0-100) for responsive scaling
- Convert pointer events to percentage: `(clientX - rect.left) / rect.width * 100`
- Convert percentage to pixels for rendering: `(percentage / 100) * canvas.width`
- This allows annotations to scale with photo on different screen sizes

**Existing Files to Modify:**
```
src/components/photos/PhotoViewer.tsx  # Add "Annotate" button

**Integration with Existing Code:**
- PhotoViewer already exists at `src/components/photos/PhotoViewer.tsx`
- Photo types defined in `src/lib/types/photo.ts`
- Photo encryption utilities at `src/lib/utils/photoEncryption.ts`
- No conflicts expected with existing photo infrastructure

### Testing Standards Summary

- Test arrow drawing calculations (arrowhead points)
- Test circle drawing calculations (radius from drag distance)
- Test rectangle drawing calculations (width/height from corners)
- Test color selection state updates
- Test line width selection state updates
- Mock Canvas API for rendering tests

**Integration Tests:**
- Test PhotoAnnotation modal opens from PhotoViewer
- Test tool selection updates selectedTool state
- Test drawing creates annotation in annotations array
- Test color/width selectors update toolConfig
- Test multiple shapes render correctly

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**
- Test full annotation workflow: open photo â†’ annotate â†’ view result
- Test touch input on mobile viewport
- Test mouse input on desktop viewport
- Test performance (60fps during drawing)

**Testing Files:**
