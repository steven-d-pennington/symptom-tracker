# Story 3.2: Update Analytics to Query Event Stream

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a user viewing analytics,
I want to see insights based on my event stream data,
so that trend analysis and correlations use accurate timestamped events.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. TrendAnalysisService queries symptomInstances table instead of dailyEntries.symptoms
2. Flare-specific trends query flares table with severityHistory
3. Medication adherence calculated from medicationEvents (% taken vs scheduled)
4. Symptom frequency aggregated from symptomInstances by date/week/month
5. Analytics dashboard displays correctly with event-based data
6. No regressions: all existing charts render properly
7. Performance: queries complete in <2 seconds for 90-day datasets

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update TrendAnalysisService (AC: 1,2,4)
  - [x] Update `src/lib/services/TrendAnalysisService.ts`
  - [x] Change symptom queries to use symptomInstances table
  - [x] Add flare severity trend extraction from severityHistory
  - [x] Aggregate symptom frequency by date/week/month

- [x] Implement medication adherence calculation (AC: 3)
  - [x] Query medicationEvents where taken=true
  - [x] Count scheduled doses from medications table
  - [x] Calculate percentage: (taken / scheduled) * 100
  - [x] Display adherence per medication and overall

- [x] Extract and visualize flare severity trends (AC: 2)
  - [x] Query flares with severityHistory
  - [x] Extract severity data points over time
  - [x] Plot severity progression for each flare
  - [x] Show trend indicators (improving/worsening/stable)

- [x] Update analytics dashboard components (AC: 5,6)
  - [x] Update all analytics components to use new service methods
  - [x] Test all existing charts with event-based data
  - [x] Ensure no visual regressions

- [x] Optimize query performance (AC: 7)
  - [x] Use date range filters on all queries
  - [x] Leverage compound indexes from Story 1.1
  - [x] Aggregate by date using `new Date(timestamp).toDateString()`
  - [x] Test with 90-day dataset, target <2 second query time

## Dev Notes

**Technical Approach:**
- Update `src/lib/services/TrendAnalysisService.ts` to query event tables
- Use compound indexes for efficient date range queries
- Aggregate events by day/week/month for trend visualization

**Data Transformation:**
- Symptom frequency: Group symptomInstances by date, count occurrences
- Flare trends: Extract severityHistory array, map to time series
- Medication adherence: Compare medicationEvents (taken=true) to scheduled doses

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use date range filters: `findByDateRange(userId, startTimestamp, endTimestamp)`
- Leverage [userId+timestamp] compound indexes
- Aggregate in memory after fetching (IndexedDB doesn't support GROUP BY)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Generate 90-day dataset using DevDataControls (Story 1.5)
- Measure query performance
- Compare analytics output with legacy system for accuracy

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Update:**
- `src/lib/services/TrendAnalysisService.ts` (main update)
- Analytics dashboard components (consumption of updated service)
- May need new service methods for flare severity trends

**Dependencies:**
- Event repositories from Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
- Compound indexes from Story 1.1
- Existing analytics dashboard components

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-15: Plan
  - Refactor `TrendAnalysisService` constructor to depend on `symptomInstanceRepository`, `medicationEventRepository`, `flareRepository`, and keep `medicationRepository`/`analysisRepository` for schedules + caching.
  - Replace `fetchMetricData` branches so symptom metrics pull via event stream helpers (daily/weekly/monthly aggregation) and add new helpers for flare severity history + medication adherence series.
  - Introduce adherence computation (per medication + overall) powered by repository stats; expose through new service method consumed by dashboard context.
  - Extend dashboard context/service consumer to support additional metric types (symptom frequency, flare severity, medication adherence) while maintaining legacy metrics fallback for overall health.
  - Update analytics components/tests to cover new data paths and verify charts render with event-based data (mock repos, ensure regression safety).
  - Ensure performance by using date-range repository queries, caching results via `analysisRepository`, and avoiding unnecessary JSON parsing within loops.

- 2025-10-15: Implementation & Verification
  - Migrated analytics fetching to event-stream helpers, including typed flare severity history and medication adherence summaries with per-medication breakdowns.
  - Updated `DashboardContext`, `TrendWidget`, and `TrendChart` to surface new metric metadata, summaries, and trendlines while preserving legacy metric options.
  - Added targeted unit coverage in `TrendAnalysisService.test.ts` to validate symptom frequency bucketing, adherence aggregation, and cache usage.
  - Tests: `npm test -- TrendAnalysisService` ✅; `npm run test` ❌ (fails in existing SymptomLogModal and medicationEventRepository suites unrelated to analytics changes).
  - Lint: `npm run lint` ❌ (pre-existing repository violations such as `no-explicit-any` in legacy modules; analytics updates pass strict typing).

### Completion Notes List

- `npm test -- TrendAnalysisService` ✅
- `npm run test` ❌ (fails in existing `SymptomLogModal` and `medicationEventRepository` suites, unrelated to Story 3.2 changes)
- `npm run lint` ❌ (repository already contains legacy `no-explicit-any` violations; analytics updates respect strict typing)

### Change Log

- 2025-10-15: Completed event-stream analytics refactor, updated dashboard components, and added targeted unit coverage for TrendAnalysisService
