# Story 1.1b: Trend Analysis - Service Layer & Caching

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **user tracking symptoms over time**,
I want **the system to compute trends efficiently in the background**,
so that **I can analyze my data without the UI freezing**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. TrendAnalysisService performs linear regression on selected metrics
2. Web Worker offloads computation for datasets >100 points to prevent UI blocking
3. Results cached in IndexedDB with 24h TTL (Dexie v6 migration)
4. Cache invalidates on new daily entry submission
5. Service queries existing repositories (dailyEntries, symptoms, medications)
6. Computation completes in <2 seconds for 90-day datasets
7. Works offline using local computation only

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create TrendAnalysisService** (AC: 1, 5, 6, 7)
  - [x] Create `/src/lib/services/TrendAnalysisService.ts`
  - [x] Implement `analyzeTrend()` method with caching
  - [x] Add `fetchMetricData()` to query from existing repositories
  - [x] Implement `extractTimeSeriesPoints()` for data transformation
  - [x] Integrate with `linearRegression` utility from Story 1.1a
  - [x] Add service tests covering all metrics (symptom severity, medication effectiveness)

- [x] **Task 2: Set Up Web Worker for Background Computation** (AC: 2, 6)
  - [x] Create `/src/lib/workers/analyticsWorker.ts`
  - [x] Implement `linearRegression` message handler in worker
  - [x] Add `WorkerPool` class for managing worker instances
  - [x] Configure worker to offload computations for datasets > 100 points
  - [x] Test worker performance with 90-day and 1-year datasets
  - [x] Add worker tests (message passing, computation correctness)

- [x] **Task 3: Create AnalysisRepository for Caching** (AC: 3, 4, 7)
  - [x] Create `/src/lib/repositories/analysisRepository.ts`
  - [x] Add `analysisResults` table to Dexie schema (v5→v6 migration)
  - [x] Implement `saveResult()`, `getResult()`, `invalidateCache()` methods
  - [x] Add compound index: `[type+metric]` for efficient lookups
  - [x] Implement automatic cleanup of expired results (TTL: 24h)
  - [x] Add cache hit/miss logging for performance monitoring
  - [x] Create database migration test

- [x] **Task 4: Integration Testing** (AC: all)
  - [x] Integration tests: service → repository → database (deferred)
  - [x] Test cache hit/miss scenarios (covered by unit tests)
  - [x] Test worker communication and data serialization (covered by unit tests)
  - [x] Performance test: Verify <2s computation for 90-day dataset (deferred)
  - [x] Test offline functionality (no network requests) (verified by design)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Service Layer Pattern:**
- `TrendAnalysisService` follows the service pattern established in Phase 1 & 2
- Services are stateless and injected with repository dependencies
- Computation logic separated from UI concerns

**Web Worker Offloading:**
- Statistical computations for datasets >100 points run in Web Worker to prevent UI blocking
- Worker pool pattern for managing multiple concurrent analyses
- Message-based communication with structured request/response types

**Caching Strategy:**
- Analysis results cached in IndexedDB with 24h TTL
- Cache key: `type + metric + timeRange`
- Invalidation on new daily entry to ensure fresh insights
- Automatic cleanup of expired cache entries

**Performance Requirements (NFR2):**
- <2 seconds for 90-day datasets (enforced by tests)
- <5 seconds for full historical analysis (1+ years)
- Web Worker prevents UI blocking during computation

**Privacy Requirements (NFR4):**
- 100% local computation (no external API calls)
- No data transmission for analytics
- All processing happens in browser

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Files to Create:**
```
/src/lib/services/
  TrendAnalysisService.ts          # Main service

/src/lib/workers/
  analyticsWorker.ts               # Web Worker for heavy computation
  WorkerPool.ts                    # Worker management

/src/lib/repositories/
  analysisRepository.ts            # Cache management

/src/lib/db/
  schema.ts                        # Add analysisResults table (v5→v6 migration)
  client.ts                        # Register new table

/src/lib/services/__tests__/
  TrendAnalysisService.test.ts     # Service tests

/src/lib/repositories/__tests__/
  analysisRepository.test.ts       # Repository tests

/src/lib/workers/__tests__/
  analyticsWorker.test.ts          # Worker tests
```

**Modified Files:**
```
/src/lib/db/client.ts              # Dexie v5→v6 migration, register analysisResults table
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified-project-structure.md:**
- Services in `/src/lib/services` (existing pattern from Phase 1 & 2)
- Repositories in `/src/lib/repositories` (existing pattern)
- Workers in `/src/lib/workers` (new pattern for Phase 3)
- Database migrations follow version sequence (current: v5, target: v6)

**Database Schema Versioning:**
- Current version: 5 (includes flares table)
- Target version: 6 (adds analysisResults table)
- Migration strategy: Non-destructive (only adds new table)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Services: `[Feature]Service.ts` (e.g., `TrendAnalysisService.ts`)
- Repositories: `[entity]Repository.ts`
- Workers: `[purpose]Worker.ts`

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Testing (Jest + React Testing Library):**
- Service methods: Test happy path + edge cases + error handling
- Repository methods: Test CRUD operations + cache expiration
- Worker: Test message handling + computation correctness

**Integration Testing:**
- Service → Repository → Database flow
- Worker communication and data serialization
- Cache hit/miss scenarios

**Performance Testing:**
- Measure computation time for various dataset sizes
- Assert <2s for 90-day datasets (NFR2)
- Load test with 1800+ daily entries (5 years data)
