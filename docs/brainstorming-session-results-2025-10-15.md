## Technique Sessions

### Technique: SCAMPER Method – Emoji-Driven Daily Engagement Loop

- **Substitute:** Replace the static mood slider with an emoji-based quick-tap carousel to make emotional logging fast, expressive, and playful.
- **Combine:** Pair each selected emoji with a micro-journaling prompt that unlocks context-specific reflections, deepening the daily ritual.
- **Adapt:** Introduce mood-based streaks that unlock encouraging reflections after three consecutive logs to reinforce consistency.
- **Modify/Magnify:** Layer animated celebrations on top of streak milestones so progress feels delightful and worth sharing.
- **Put to Other Uses:** Transform mood logs into personalized daily affirmations surfaced on the home feed to spark re-engagement.
- **Eliminate:** Remove the multi-step symptom rating wizard on streak days for a frictionless “tap + jot” experience.
- **Reverse/Rearrange:** Let sentiment analysis of the micro-journal auto-suggest the most fitting emoji, creating a moment of insight before confirmation.

### Technique: Analogical Thinking – Duolingo-Inspired Habit Loop

- **Daily Health Points:** Introduce Duolingo-style “energy” that only refills when users complete their log, turning consistency into a tangible resource.
- **Empathetic Mascot Nudges:** Deploy an animated companion that delivers caring reminders before streak breaks, echoing Duolingo’s playful coach persona.
- **Wellness Leagues:** Create gentle weekly leaderboards among trusted friends so users celebrate consistency together instead of competing on symptom severity.
