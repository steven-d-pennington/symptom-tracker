# symptom-tracker - Epic Breakdown

**Author:** BMad User
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Project Level:** Level 3 (Full Product)
**Target Scale:** Phase 3 Intelligence Layer - 18-25 stories across 3 epics

---

## Epic Overview

Phase 3 introduces the Intelligence Layer through three strategic epics that transform the Pocket Symptom Tracker from a data collection tool into a decision support system. These epics build sequentially: **Epic 1 (Data Analysis)** creates the analytical foundation, **Epic 2 (Search & Filtering)** enables data discovery, and **Epic 3 (Report Generation)** facilitates clinical communication.

**Epic Summary:**
- **Epic 1: Data Analysis & Insights Engine** - 7-9 stories - Local analytics for pattern discovery and predictions
- **Epic 2: Advanced Search & Filtering** - 6-8 stories - Instant search across all health data
- **Epic 3: Professional Report Generation** - 5-8 stories - Medical-grade reports for consultations

**Total Story Count:** 18-25 stories
**Implementation Timeline:** Sequential (Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 3)

- Integration with external health data sources (wearables, lab results)
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Real-time data streaming and alerts

**Search Enhancements (Future):**
- Voice search capabilities
- Image search for photo documentation
- Cross-user anonymized pattern search
- AI-powered semantic search
- Search API for third-party integrations

**Report Features (Future):**
- Interactive reports with embedded calculators
- Video attachments and multimedia content
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Integration with EHR systems (HL7 FHIR)
