## 🎨 New Features

### 1. Scenario-Based Generation

7 predefined scenarios optimized for specific testing needs:

| Icon | Scenario | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 🎯 | **Quick Start** | First-time exploration | 1 week, basic coverage |
| 🔥 | **Flare Progression** | Flare tracking | Detailed event histories, high interventions |
| 🍽️ | **Food Correlations** | Food analysis | High-confidence patterns, synergistic combos |
| ⚠️ | **Trigger Analysis** | Correlation testing | Clear causal links, varied delays |
| 🗺️ | **Problem Areas** | Regional analytics | Clustered flares, 3+ per region |
| 📊 | **Comprehensive** | Complete testing | All features, mixed confidence levels |
| 🚀 | **Stress Test** | Performance testing | High volume, 2 years default |

### 2. Year Selector

- Range: 1-5 years
- Visual slider with labels
- Dynamically adjusts data volumes
- Scales flare counts based on duration

### 3. Flare Event History

**Event Types Generated:**
- `created` - Initial flare creation
- `severity_update` - Severity changes (3-10 per flare)
- `trend_change` - Status shifts (improving/worsening)
- `intervention` - Treatments (ice, heat, medication, drainage)
- `resolved` - Flare resolution with notes

**Patterns:**
- Improving (35% of flares)
- Worsening (20%)
- Stable (20%)
- Fluctuating (25%)

### 4. Food Combination Analysis

**Pattern Types:**
```typescript
High Confidence (n ≥ 10, correlation 80%+):
- Milk + Cheese → Inflammation (83% correlation)
- Tomatoes + Bell Peppers → Painful Nodules (80%)

Medium Confidence (n ≥ 5, correlation 50-70%):
- Bread + Pasta → Fatigue (57%)
- Bacon + Sausage → Joint Pain (67%)

Low Confidence (n < 5 or weak correlation):
- Orange + Lemon → Headache (50%, n=4)
```

**Also Generates:**
- Individual food correlations (non-combinations)
- Synergistic detection (combination > individual + 15%)
- Realistic delay windows (2-24 hours)

### 5. Trigger-Symptom Correlations

**Patterns:**
```typescript
High Correlation (80%+):
- Stress → Headache (83%, 2-4h delay)
- Dairy → Inflammation (80%, 6-12h delay)

Medium Correlation (50-70%):
- Poor Sleep → Fatigue (67%, immediate)
- Tight Clothing → Painful Nodules (60%, 4-8h delay)

Low Correlation (noise, <40%):
- Stress → Joint Pain (30%, 12-24h delay)
```

### 6. Problem Area Clustering

When enabled:
- Clusters flares in 3-4 specific regions
- Ensures 3+ flares per "problem region"
- Weighted distribution:
  - Armpit Right: 30%
  - Groin Left: 25%
  - Under Breast Right: 25%
  - Buttocks Left: 20%

### 7. Body Map Locations

- 70% of symptom instances get body map locations
- 60% have precise coordinates (x, y: 0-1 normalized)
- 40% are region-only (no coordinates)
- Uses gaussian distribution for realistic clustering
- Maps symptoms to appropriate body regions

### 8. UX Event Simulation

**Event Types:**
- `quickAction.flare` (12% of events)
- `quickAction.medication` (18%)
- `quickAction.symptom` (10%)
- `quickAction.trigger` (13%)
- `quickAction.food` (17%)
- `navigation.destination.select` (70%)

**Patterns:**
- 60% of days have activity
- 3-15 events per active day
- Simulates user sessions (10-30 minutes)
- Events spaced 1-3 minutes apart

### 9. Photo Blob Generation

**Attempted with Canvas:**
- Generates 400x400 colored placeholder images
- Severity-based colors:
  - Green (1-3): Mild
  - Yellow (4-6): Moderate
  - Orange (7-8): Severe
  - Red (9-10): Critical
- Includes text labels and timestamps
- Creates thumbnails (100x100)
- Falls back gracefully if canvas unavailable

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Photo Generation
**Issue:** Canvas may not be available in all browsers/environments
**Workaround:** Falls back gracefully, logs warning
**Impact:** Photo features require manual testing
**Status:** Acceptable - photo testing not critical

### 2. Import Paths in Orchestrator
**Issue:** Some imports reference functions from existing generators
**Fix Required:** May need to extract shared functions or duplicate code
**Impact:** May cause TypeScript errors on first build
**Priority:** Medium

### 3. Food Combination Table Not Populated
**Issue:** `FoodCombinationRecord` table not explicitly populated
**Explanation:** Combinations computed by `CombinationAnalysisService` on demand
**Impact:** None - working as designed
**Action:** No fix needed

### 4. Scenario Descriptions Could Be More Detailed
**Issue:** Scenario cards have brief descriptions
**Enhancement:** Could add "Learn More" modal with examples
**Priority:** Low

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Improvements (Future)

1. **Custom Scenario Builder**
   - UI to create custom scenarios
   - Save/load scenario configurations
   - Share scenarios between users

2. **Data Export on Generation**
   - Auto-export CSV after generation
   - Include summary statistics
   - Save generation logs

3. **Visual Data Previews**
   - Charts showing data distribution
   - Sample events preview before generating
   - Estimated generation time

4. **Incremental Generation**
   - Add data to existing dataset (don't clear)
   - "Top up" scenarios (add 1 more month)
   - Selective regeneration (only flares, only food)

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Web Worker for generation (don't block UI)
   - Progress updates during generation
   - Batch size optimization for large datasets

6. **Testing Utilities**
   - Validate generated data integrity
   - Check referential integrity (foreign keys)
   - Verify correlation calculations
   - Export test report

## 📝 Breaking Changes

### For Developers

1. **Import Paths Changed:**
   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { generateEventStreamData } from "@/lib/dev/generateEventStreamData";

   // New
   import { generateComprehensiveData } from "@/lib/dev/generators/orchestrator";
   import { getScenarioConfig } from "@/lib/dev/config/scenarios";
   ```

2. **DevDataControls API:**
   - Old component had `handlePopulateClick`, `handleEventStreamClick`, `handleFoodEventClick`
   - New component has single `handleGenerateScenario` method
   - Props/exports remain compatible

3. **Legacy Daily Entries:**
   - `populateDevDemoData()` still exists but not exposed in UI
   - Can be called programmatically if needed
   - Recommend migrating tests to new scenarios

### For Users

**No Breaking Changes** - UI is fully backward compatible. Users can:
- Still use Quick Actions for simple generation
- Access all previous functionality
- Clear data as before

## 💾 Backup & Rollback

### Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, revert to old version:

```bash
# From project root
cd C:\projects\symptom-tracker\src\components\settings

# Restore old version
mv DevDataControls.tsx DevDataControls.new.tsx
mv DevDataControls.old.tsx DevDataControls.tsx

# Refresh app - old version will be active
```

### Backup Preserved
- Old DevDataControls saved as `DevDataControls.old.tsx`
- Old generators still exist and functional
- Can be restored at any time

// Generate 2 years of comprehensive data
const config = getScenarioConfig('comprehensive', 2);
const result = await generateComprehensiveData(userId, config);

console.log(`Created ${result.flaresCreated} flares with ${result.flareEventsCreated} events`);
```

**Creating a custom scenario:**
```typescript
import { GeneratorConfig } from "@/lib/dev/generators/base/types";

const customConfig: GeneratorConfig = {
  timeRange: { daysBack: 90, yearsToGenerate: 0.25 },
  flares: {
    count: { min: 5, max: 8 },
    regionClustering: true,
    generateEvents: true,
    eventsPerFlare: { min: 5, max: 10 },
    interventionProbability: 0.8,
  },
  // ... other settings
};

const result = await generateComprehensiveData(userId, customConfig);
```
