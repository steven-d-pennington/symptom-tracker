- Solution architecture delivered (`docs/solution-architecture.md` updated 2025-10-16) with epic alignment matrix and cron-backed analytics plan.
- Epic 2 technical specification authored (`docs/tech-spec-epic-E2.md`) completing per-epic planning alongside existing Epic 1 spec.
- Story 1.1 (`docs/stories/story-1.1.md`) marked Ready with context captured in `docs/stories/story-context-1.1.xml`.
