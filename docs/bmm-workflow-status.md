### Next Action Required

**ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL BUG FIX: Story 3.5.10**

A critical regression was discovered that crashes the calendar page. This must be fixed before proceeding to Epic 4.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Implement Story 3.5.10:** CRITICAL: Calendar page crashes on loading data
   - Command: `*dev-story`
   - Agent: `dev` (Developer)

---

## Decision Log

- **2025-11-01:** Created Story 3.6.1: Interactive Data Selection During Onboarding. This story expands the onboarding flow to allow users to interactively select symptoms, triggers, medications, and foods instead of auto-populating all defaults. Features include: collapsible category organization, real-time search across all data types, ability to add custom items during onboarding, and GUID-based user ID generation for cloud sync preparation. Story includes 13 acceptance criteria and 16 detailed tasks. Priority: HIGH (13 story points).

- **2025-10-31:** Created Story 3.5.10 to address a critical regression in the calendar page (`SyntaxError: "undefined" is not valid JSON`). This bug blocks production readiness. The start of Epic 4 is paused until this fix is implemented and verified. The next action is for the DEV agent to run `*dev-story` to implement the fix.

- **2025-10-31:** Corrected workflow status to reflect completion of Epic 3.5. The epic concluded with 9 stories (52 points), including the addition of story 3.5.9. All stories (3.5.1 through 3.5.9) are now marked as DONE. Phase 4 (Implementation) is now complete. The project is unblocked and ready to begin Epic 4 (Photo Documentation). The next action is for the Scrum Master to run `*create-story` to draft story 4.1.
