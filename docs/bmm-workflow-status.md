## Current Epic: Production-Ready UI/UX Enhancement (Epic 3.5)

### Focus Areas
1. **Empty State Resolution** - Pre-populate defaults, fix critical onboarding drop-off
2. **Modal ‚Üí Page Redesign** - Convert logging from modals to dedicated pages
3. **Essential Feature Addition** - Mood & sleep tracking (clinically essential)
4. **Critical UI Fixes** - Dark mode, calendar, navigation, accessibility

### Epic Background
Created from comprehensive UI/UX brainstorming session (2025-10-29). Identified through role-playing (first-time/daily/power user perspectives) and expert panel review (UX designer, mobile dev, accessibility expert, product manager, medical expert). This epic represents Phase 0 (Critical Fixes) and must complete BEFORE Epic 4 to ensure production readiness.

## Decision Log

- **2025-10-30:** Completed Story 3.5.6 (Critical UI Fixes Bundle) and marked done. Epic 3.5 now at 75% complete (6/8 stories). 39 of 47 points delivered (83%). Remaining stories: 3.5.7 (Fix Calendar Data Wiring - 3 pts) and 3.5.8 (Add Keyboard Navigation - 5 pts). Both stories ready-for-dev. Next action: Implement Story 3.5.7 using dev-story workflow with DEV agent.

- **2025-10-29:** Epic 3.5 Story Drafting COMPLETE. All 8 stories drafted in non-interactive mode using SM agent with comprehensive specifications. Story files created in docs/stories/3-5-*.md with full acceptance criteria (7-10 ACs per story), tasks/subtasks (8-11 tasks per story), dev notes with architecture patterns, implementation guidance, schema considerations, and testing strategy. All stories include critical reminders for import/export compatibility and devdatacontrols updates where applicable. Story breakdown: (1) Fix Empty State Crisis - 8pts CRITICAL, (2) Mood & Sleep Basic Logging - 8pts HIGH, (3) Redesign Symptom Logging - 5pts HIGH, (4) Redesign Food Logging - 8pts HIGH, (5) Redesign Trigger/Medication Logging - 5pts HIGH, (6) Critical UI Fixes Bundle - 5pts HIGH, (7) Fix Calendar Data Wiring - 3pts MEDIUM, (8) Add Keyboard Navigation - 5pts MEDIUM. Total: 47 points. Updated sprint-status.yaml: marked epic-3.5 as "contexted" and all 8 stories as "drafted". Updated bmm-workflow-status.md: Current state shows Epic 3.5 at 100% drafting complete, next action is story context XML generation. Epic 3.5 sourced from brainstorming session (docs/brainstorming-session-results-2025-10-29.md) with role-playing, assumption reversal, SCAMPER method, and expert panel review. Story drafting utilized epics.md (full story breakdown), PRD.md (requirements), and epic-3.5-production-ux.md (detailed epic document). Next step: Run story-context workflow for each story to generate developer-ready XML context files and mark stories as ready-for-dev.

- **2025-10-29:** Created Epic 3.5 (Production-Ready UI/UX Enhancement) from comprehensive UI/UX brainstorming session. Session used Role Playing (first-time/daily/power user perspectives), Assumption Reversal (challenging design assumptions), SCAMPER Method (systematic improvement), and Expert Panel Review (5 domain experts: UX designer, mobile dev, accessibility expert, product manager, medical expert). Identified critical production-readiness issues: (1) Empty State Crisis - new users can't log anything (unanimous #1), (2) Modal Cascade Failure - modals causing multiple UX problems, (3) Missing Essential Features - mood/sleep clinically essential, (4) Broken Functionality - dark mode, calendar, outdated content. Epic 3.5 defines Phase 0 (Critical Fixes): 8 stories, 47 points estimated, 2-3 weeks duration. MUST complete before Epic 4 (Photo Documentation). Epic 4 stories deferred. Documents created: docs/epic-3.5-production-ux.md (epic definition with 8 story outlines), docs/brainstorming-session-results-2025-10-29.md (full brainstorming session with 50+ ideas across 4 phases). Updated bmm-workflow-status.md: inserted Epic 3.5 into backlog, marked Epic 4 as deferred, updated current state to "Epic 3.5 Ready". Next action: Begin Story 3.5.1 (Empty State Crisis) via story-context workflow.

- **2025-10-29:** Completed Epic 3 Retrospective workflow. Generated comprehensive retrospective document (docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-10-29.md) with full team discussion.

Key findings: architectural consistency across all 5 stories, test-driven quality baseline, parallel data fetching for performance. Identified 4 action items for process improvements (pre-commit type checking, context files requirement, ethical/safety review, Chart.js documentation). Defined 11-task Epic 4 preparation sprint (25 hours estimated): image compression spike, PhotoRepository interface, EXIF stripping, Lighthouse CI integration, FileUpload component, user research. Critical path: compression spike ‚Üí storage research ‚Üí interface design. Updated sprint-status.yaml: epic-3-retrospective marked as completed. Epic 3 now 100% complete with retrospective done. Ready for Epic 4 preparation sprint.
