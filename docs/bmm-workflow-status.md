- **2025-10-20:** Completed story-context for Story 1.5 (Display Flare Markers on Body Map). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.5.xml. Generated comprehensive implementation context including: 8 documentation artifacts (PRD, Architecture, Epics, prerequisite stories 1.1-1.3), 7 code artifacts (FlareRecord schema, flareRepository, bodyRegions data, BodyMapZoom component, integration points), 12 constraints (region-level positioning, TransformComponent integration, inverse zoom scaling, NFR001 performance, groin region support), 5 interfaces (FlareRecord, BodyRegion, flareRepository API, TransformComponent, useRouter), 13 dependency packages (React 19.1.0, Next.js 15.5.4, react-zoom-pan-pinch 3.6.1, Dexie 4.2.0, Jest 30.2.0), testing standards (Jest + React Testing Library), 3 test file locations, 13 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria. Key findings: Story 1.4 NOT implemented (use region centers not coordinates), FlareMarkers must render inside TransformComponent for zoom/pan alignment, marker size scales inversely with zoom (radius = 8/sqrt(zoom)), radial offset algorithm for multiple flares in same region (20px radius), status-based colors (active=red-500, improving=yellow-400, worsening=orange-500, resolved=gray-400). Context provides complete implementation guidance for DEV agent. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story workflow to implement Story 1.5.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed review-story for Story 1.5 (Display Flare Markers on Body Map). Review outcome: **APPROVED** - Production ready. All 7 acceptance criteria satisfied (100% coverage). Implementation demonstrates excellent quality: FlareMarkers component properly integrated into BodyMapZoom, comprehensive test coverage (30+ tests), performance optimized with useMemo, full accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav), real-time updates via polling hook, inverse zoom scaling maintains touch-friendly markers. Files created: FlareMarkers.tsx, useFlares.ts, flareMarkers.ts utilities, 2 test suites. Files modified: bodyRegions.ts (added center coordinates to 93 regions), BodyMapZoom.tsx, BodyMapViewer.tsx, 2 page files. Security review: No vulnerabilities found. Architecture alignment: Perfect (ADR-001 compliance). Minor recommendations for future: Consider React Query migration, add error boundary, implement marker clustering for 50+ flares (all LOW priority). Story approved for production deployment. Next: User should run story-approved workflow to mark Story 1.5 complete and advance to Story 1.6.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed story-approved for Story 1.5 (Display Flare Markers on Body Map). Story officially marked Done and moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE. Implementation complete with all acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage (30+ tests), production-grade quality. Queue advanced: Story 1.6 (Body Map Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation) moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Progress: 4 of 23 stories complete (56%). Total points: 16 points completed. Epic 1 progress: 4/6 stories done (Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 complete; Story 1.4 skipped; Story 1.6 next). Next: SM agent should draft Story 1.6 using create-story workflow.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed correct-course workflow for Story 1.4 gap. Issue identified: Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View) was skipped during Epic 1 implementation, creating an architectural gap. Story 1.5 (Display Flare Markers) was implemented with region-center positioning workaround, assuming Story 1.4 would be added later. Impact analysis: Epic 1's core value proposition ("coordinate-level precision") cannot be delivered without Story 1.4. Multiple flares in same region use artificial radial offset instead of true anatomical positions. Recommendation: APPROVED - Implement Story 1.4 immediately before Story 1.6. Change scope: MINOR (Direct Adjustment). Sprint Change Proposal created documenting issue, impact, and implementation plan. Workflow status updated: Story 1.4 moved to IN PROGRESS, Story 1.6 moved back to TODO. Rationale: Maintains Epic 1 sequential integrity, delivers core precision tracking value, minimal disruption (Story 1.5 already built anticipating coordinates). Effort estimate: 5 story points, 2-4 hour implementation. Next: SM agent should draft Story 1.4 via create-story workflow.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed create-story for Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.4.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 7 acceptance criteria covering coordinate capture on click, 0-1 normalization, visual crosshair display, coordinate storage with region ID, adjustable marking, persistence across zoom/pan, and multi-flare precision. Detailed task breakdown with 6 major tasks and 35+ subtasks. Comprehensive dev notes include: CoordinateMarker component code example, coordinate normalization utilities (normalizeCoordinates, denormalizeCoordinates, getRegionBounds), schema extension for FlareRecord.coordinates field, FlareMarkers enhancement logic (use coordinates when available, fallback to region center), file modification list (2 new files, 4 modified files, 3 test files), performance targets (<100ms coordinate capture). Story fills critical gap from correct-course analysis - enables medical-grade coordinate precision for Epic 1. Builds on completed Stories 1.1 (Groin Regions), 1.2 (Zoom Controls), 1.3 (Pan Controls). Enhances Story 1.5 (Flare Markers) from region-center to coordinate-based positioning. Coordinates are optional field (backward compatible). Next: Review and approve story via story-ready workflow.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed create-story for Story 1.6 (Body Map Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.6.md. Status: Draft created ahead of schedule. Story includes 7 acceptance criteria covering tab navigation between regions, Enter/Space selection, arrow key coordinate positioning, screen reader announcements, comprehensive ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts for zoom/pan, and high-contrast focus indicators. Detailed task breakdown with 6 major tasks covering keyboard navigation, arrow key positioning, ARIA labels/screen reader support, keyboard shortcuts, focus indicators, and integration testing. Comprehensive dev notes include: keyboard navigation state machine (NAVIGATE/PAN/POSITION modes), ARIA label patterns, focus management with react-zoom-pan-pinch, keyboard shortcut implementation, WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements, file modification list (6 files to modify, 3 new hooks/components, 3 test files). Story builds on ALL Epic 1 stories (1.1-1.5) to ensure complete accessibility. Note: Draft created ahead but implementation deferred until Story 1.4 coordinate precision is complete. Next: Generate story-context for Story 1.4 (priority), then proceed with Story 1.4 implementation before returning to Story 1.6.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed story-context for Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.4.xml. Generated comprehensive implementation context including: 10 documentation artifacts (PRD FR003/NFR001, Architecture ADR-001/Data Schema, Epic 1, prerequisite stories 1.1-1.3, Story 1.5 enhancement target), 8 code artifacts (BodyMapZoom component, FlareMarkers component, flare types, bodyRegions data with 93 region centers, coordinate utilities, flare hooks, BodyMapViewer and NewFlareDialog integration points), 12 constraints (normalized 0-1 coordinates, optional field backward compatibility, Story 1.5 additive enhancement, react-zoom-pan-pinch integration, NFR001 <100ms performance, touch target 44x44px, DOM getBoundingClientRect null checks), 10 interfaces (Coordinates, SVGCoordinates, normalizeCoordinates, denormalizeCoordinates, getRegionBounds, CoordinateMarkerProps, ActiveFlare extension, ReactZoomPanPinchRef, TransformComponent, BodyRegion), 14 dependency packages (React 19.1.0, Next.js 15.5.4, react-zoom-pan-pinch 3.6.1, Dexie 4.2.0, Jest 30.2.0, RTL 16.3.0), testing standards (Jest + RTL, fake-indexeddb), 3 test file locations, 17 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria. Key findings: Coordinates normalized 0-1 scale relative to region bounds, optional field allows graceful backward compatibility, FlareMarkers enhancement uses coordinates when available with fallback to region center, must work within TransformComponent from BodyMapZoom, performance critical <100ms coordinate capture, touch targets 44x44px minimum. Context provides complete implementation guidance for DEV agent. Next: Review and approve story via story-ready workflow, then DEV agent implements Story 1.4.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed story-ready for Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View). Story marked Ready for development. Status updated from Draft → Ready in story file (docs/stories/story-1.4.md). Story remains IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development) with context file already generated (docs/stories/story-context-1.4.xml). Story 1.6 remains in TODO (awaiting Story 1.4 completion). Next: DEV agent should run `*dev-story` workflow to implement Story 1.4 - critical gap-fill for coordinate precision tracking. Implementation will enhance Story 1.5 (FlareMarkers) to use precise coordinates when available, maintaining backward compatibility with region-center fallback.
