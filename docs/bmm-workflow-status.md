## Decision Log

- **2025-10-28:** Completed Epic 0.5 (Pre-Launch Stabilization) implementation. Fixed onboarding routing bug in CompletionStep.tsx (href changed from "/" to "/dashboard"). Migrated EventDetailModal.tsx from deprecated flareRepository methods (updateSeverity/update) to new append-only API (addFlareEvent/updateFlare) following Epic 2 patterns. All console deprecation warnings eliminated. Both stories completed in ~2 hours as estimated. All acceptance criteria met. Ready for user testing.
- **2025-10-28:** Completed correct-course workflow. Sprint Change Proposal generated for 3 critical pre-launch bugs. Decision: Create Epic 0.5 (Pre-Launch Stabilization) with 2 stories to fix bugs before user launch. Scope: MINOR (Direct Adjustment). Estimated effort: 2-3 hours. Story 3.2 completed and moved to review status. Story 2.8 remains deferred.
- **2025-10-28:** Completed Story 3.2 (Per-Region Flare History) implementation. All 7 acceptance criteria met. Extended analyticsRepository with getFlaresByRegion() and getRegionStatistics(). Created useRegionAnalytics hook with 10-second polling. Implemented 6 new components: RegionFlareCard, RegionStatisticsCard, RegionFlareTimeline, FlareStatusFilter, RegionDetailView, RegionEmptyState. Updated region detail page route. Added 8 repository tests. Build successful. Story status updated to review.
- **2025-10-28:** Completed Story 3.1 (Calculate and Display Problem Areas) implementation and marked done. Created complete analytics infrastructure: analyticsRepository with getProblemAreas(), timeRange utilities, useAnalytics hook with polling, ProblemAreaRow with bar chart visualization, ProblemAreasView with loading/error/empty states, analytics page at /flares/analytics route, placeholder per-region page. All 7 acceptance criteria met. Build successful. Story moved to DONE.
- **2025-10-27:** Completed Story 2.7 (Mark Flare as Resolved) via story-approved workflow after resolving review issues. Story marked Done and moved to DONE section. All 8 acceptance criteria met with comprehensive implementation: FlareResolveModal with two-step confirmation, atomic persistence, read-only enforcement, gray markers on body map, comprehensive test coverage. Epic 2 progress: 7/8 stories complete.
