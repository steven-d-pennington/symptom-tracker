## Decision Log

- **2025-10-18:** Started new workflow status for Flare Tracking & Body Map Enhancements epic. Previous epics (Food Journal + Correlation Analysis) archived as complete.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed PRD workflow. Delivered PRD.md with 14 functional requirements, 3 non-functional requirements, user journey, and UX/UI vision. Created epics.md with full story breakdown: 23 stories total across 4 epics. Key requirements: groin regions on body map, zoom/pan for precision tracking, persistent flare entities with lifecycle tracking (onset → progression → resolution), problem area analytics, and photo documentation.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed solution-architecture workflow. Generated solution-architecture.md with complete technical design. Key decisions: Single new dependency (react-zoom-pan-pinch@3.6.1), minimal schema changes (FlareRecord coordinates link, groin regions enum), no global state management, analytics calculated on-demand. Cohesion check passed at 98% readiness. Skipped per-epic tech specs (Level 2 optimization). Populated story backlog with 23 stories across 4 epics. Phase 3 (Solutioning) complete. Ready for Phase 4 (Implementation) - SM to draft Story 1.1.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed create-story for Story 1.1 (Add Groin Regions to Body Map SVG). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.1.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Next: Review and approve story. Story includes 6 acceptance criteria, detailed task breakdown with 5 major tasks and 19 subtasks, comprehensive dev notes with architecture context, file modification list (3 files to modify, 3 test files to create), and risk mitigation strategies. Story is foundational for Epic 1 - all subsequent body map precision features build on this.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed story-ready for Story 1.1 (Add Groin Regions to Body Map SVG). Story marked Ready for development. Moved from TODO → READY FOR DEVELOPMENT. Next story 1.2 (Implement Zoom Controls for Body Map) moved from BACKLOG → TODO. Story 1.1 is now ready for context generation via story-context workflow, then implementation via dev-story workflow.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed story-context for Story 1.1 (Add Groin Regions to Body Map SVG). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.1.xml. Generated comprehensive implementation context including: existing body map infrastructure analysis (124 code references found), current groin region implementation (single region needs split into 3), SVG path coordinates, BodyRegion interface, FrontBody component patterns, dependencies (React 19.1.0, Next.js 15.5.4, TypeScript 5.x), testing standards (Jest 30.2.0, React Testing Library 16.3.0), and 7 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria. Context includes knowledge from memory about brownfield architecture patterns. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed dev-story and story-approved for Story 1.1 (Add Groin Regions to Body Map SVG). Implementation complete: Replaced single groin region with 3 separate regions (left-groin, center-groin, right-groin), added 3 ellipse SVG elements to FrontBody component, created comprehensive test suite (42 tests, 100% pass rate). Files modified: src/lib/data/bodyRegions.ts, src/components/body-mapping/bodies/FrontBody.tsx. Tests created: 3 test files (unit, component, integration). Story marked Done and moved to DONE section. Progress: 1 of 23 stories complete (33%). Next: SM should draft Story 1.2 (Implement Zoom Controls for Body Map).
- **2025-10-18:** Completed create-story for Story 1.2 (Implement Zoom Controls for Body Map). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.2.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 8 acceptance criteria covering zoom controls UI, pinch-to-zoom, scroll-wheel zoom, zoom range (1x-3x), cursor-focused zoom, state persistence, reset functionality, and <100ms performance target. Detailed task breakdown with 6 major tasks and 37 subtasks. Comprehensive dev notes include: ADR-001 decision to use react-zoom-pan-pinch library, complete code examples for BodyMapZoom component and useBodyMapZoom hook, file modification guidance, testing strategy, performance targets, and risk mitigation. Story builds on groin regions from 1.1 and enables pan controls (1.3) and coordinate marking (1.4). Next: Review and approve story via story-ready workflow.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed story-ready for Story 1.2 (Implement Zoom Controls for Body Map). Story marked Ready for development. Moved from READY FOR REVIEW → IN PROGRESS. Story 1.2 is now ready for context generation via story-context workflow, then implementation via dev-story workflow. Next: Generate context or proceed directly to implementation.
- **2025-10-18:** Completed story-context for Story 1.2 (Implement Zoom Controls for Body Map). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.2.xml. Generated comprehensive implementation context including: 98 code references found (BodyMapViewer, FrontBody/BackBody components, existing body map infrastructure), react-zoom-pan-pinch@3.6.1 ALREADY INSTALLED (no npm install needed), 9 code artifacts identified (BodyMapViewer integration point, groin regions from Story 1.1), 12 constraints including NFR001 (<100ms performance), 6 interface definitions from library and existing code, 12 test ideas mapped to acceptance criteria. Key findings: Library already installed, new directory needed (src/components/body-map/), must preserve groin region functionality from Story 1.1. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.
