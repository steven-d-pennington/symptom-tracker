## Decision Log

- **2025-10-27:** Retroactively approved Story 2.3 (Active Flares Dashboard) via story-approved workflow. Story was fully implemented on 2025-10-23 with all 6 tasks complete and 7 acceptance criteria met, but formal approval step was skipped when workflow jumped from Story 2.2 to Story 2.4. Implementation verified: FlaresPage component exists (15,824 bytes) with ActiveFlareCards, ActiveFlareCard, and ActiveFlaresEmptyState components. Story provides Active Flares page at /flares route with filtered list using useFlares hook, comprehensive flare information display (body region, severity with color coding, trend arrows, days active, last updated), sortable by severity/recent updates with localStorage persistence, navigation to detail page, empty state guidance, pull-to-refresh on mobile, and flare count badge. All acceptance criteria satisfied: AC2.3.1 (filtered list at /flares), AC2.3.2 (comprehensive info display), AC2.3.3 (sortable with persistence), AC2.3.4 (navigation to detail page), AC2.3.5 (empty state), AC2.3.6 (pull-to-refresh), AC2.3.7 (count badge). Story status updated from "Ready for Review" to "Done". Workflow status updated: Story 2.3 moved to DONE section. Progress corrected: 17 of 23 stories complete (78%, was incorrectly showing 76%), 96 points (was incorrectly showing 88 points). Epic 2 progress corrected: 5/8 stories complete (62.5%, was incorrectly showing 4/8 = 50%). This approval fills a critical gap in the workflow tracking - Active Flares Dashboard has been operational since Story 2.3 implementation and was used as foundation for Stories 2.4 and 2.5.
- **2025-10-27:** Completed create-story for Story 2.6 (View Flare History Timeline). Story file: docs/stories/story-2.6.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 7 acceptance criteria covering: (1) History tab in flare detail view with keyboard-accessible tab navigation, (2) comprehensive timeline entries displaying date/time (relative + full on hover), event type icons (status update/intervention/trend change), severity badges (previous → current), trend arrows (↑ ↓ →), intervention details, and notes, (3) reverse-chronological sorting (most recent first), (4) Chart.js line chart showing severity progression over time with intervention annotation markers using chartjs-plugin-annotation, (5) filterable timeline (All Events/Status Updates Only/Interventions Only) with localStorage persistence, (6) expandable timeline entries for full details view (read-only, enforcing immutability per ADR-003), (7) performance optimization with React.memo, useMemo, virtual scrolling for > 100 events, <300ms load target for 30 events. Detailed task breakdown with 7 major tasks and 87 subtasks. Comprehensive dev notes include: complete FlareHistory component code with filter state and React Query integration, FlareHistoryEntry component with expand/collapse and event type rendering, FlareHistoryChart component with Chart.js configuration and intervention annotations, tab navigation integration in flare detail page. Story builds on Story 2.1 data layer (getFlareHistory), Story 2.4 status update events, Story 2.5 intervention events and display patterns. Implements PRD FR008 complete history tracking. Prepares unified timeline visualization for Epic 2 completion and Epic 3 analytics. Next: Review and approve story via story-ready workflow.

Implementation demonstrates excellent quality: FlareMarkers component properly integrated into BodyMapZoom, comprehensive test coverage (30+ tests), performance optimized with useMemo, full accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav), real-time updates via polling hook, inverse zoom scaling maintains touch-friendly markers. Files created: FlareMarkers.tsx, useFlares.ts, flareMarkers.ts utilities, 2 test suites. Files modified: bodyRegions.ts (added center coordinates to 93 regions), BodyMapZoom.tsx, BodyMapViewer.tsx, 2 page files. Security review: No vulnerabilities found. Architecture alignment: Perfect (ADR-001 compliance). Minor recommendations for future: Consider React Query migration, add error boundary, implement marker clustering for 50+ flares (all LOW priority). Story approved for production deployment. Next: User should run story-approved workflow to mark Story 1.5 complete and advance to Story 1.6.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed story-approved for Story 1.5 (Display Flare Markers on Body Map). Story officially marked Done and moved from IN PROGRESS → DONE. Implementation complete with all acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage (30+ tests), production-grade quality. Queue advanced: Story 1.6 (Body Map Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation) moved from TODO → IN PROGRESS. Progress: 4 of 23 stories complete (56%). Total points: 16 points completed. Epic 1 progress: 4/6 stories done (Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 complete; Story 1.4 skipped; Story 1.6 next). Next: SM agent should draft Story 1.6 using create-story workflow.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed correct-course workflow for Story 1.4 gap. Issue identified: Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View) was skipped during Epic 1 implementation, creating an architectural gap. Story 1.5 (Display Flare Markers) was implemented with region-center positioning workaround, assuming Story 1.4 would be added later. Impact analysis: Epic 1's core value proposition ("coordinate-level precision") cannot be delivered without Story 1.4. Multiple flares in same region use artificial radial offset instead of true anatomical positions. Recommendation: APPROVED - Implement Story 1.4 immediately before Story 1.6. Change scope: MINOR (Direct Adjustment). Sprint Change Proposal created documenting issue, impact, and implementation plan. Workflow status updated: Story 1.4 moved to IN PROGRESS, Story 1.6 moved back to TODO. Rationale: Maintains Epic 1 sequential integrity, delivers core precision tracking value, minimal disruption (Story 1.5 already built anticipating coordinates). Effort estimate: 5 story points, 2-4 hour implementation. Next: SM agent should draft Story 1.4 via create-story workflow.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed create-story for Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.4.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 7 acceptance criteria covering coordinate capture on click, 0-1 normalization, visual crosshair display, coordinate storage with region ID, adjustable marking, persistence across zoom/pan, and multi-flare precision. Detailed task breakdown with 6 major tasks and 35+ subtasks. Comprehensive dev notes include: CoordinateMarker component code example, coordinate normalization utilities (normalizeCoordinates, denormalizeCoordinates, getRegionBounds), schema extension for FlareRecord.coordinates field, FlareMarkers enhancement logic (use coordinates when available, fallback to region center), file modification list (2 new files, 4 modified files, 3 test files), performance targets (<100ms coordinate capture). Story fills critical gap from correct-course analysis - enables medical-grade coordinate precision for Epic 1. Builds on completed Stories 1.1 (Groin Regions), 1.2 (Zoom Controls), 1.3 (Pan Controls). Enhances Story 1.5 (Flare Markers) from region-center to coordinate-based positioning. Coordinates are optional field (backward compatible). Next: Review and approve story via story-ready workflow.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed create-story for Story 1.6 (Body Map Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation). Story file: docs/stories/story-1.6.md. Status: Draft created ahead of schedule. Story includes 7 acceptance criteria covering tab navigation between regions, Enter/Space selection, arrow key coordinate positioning, screen reader announcements, comprehensive ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts for zoom/pan, and high-contrast focus indicators. Detailed task breakdown with 6 major tasks covering keyboard navigation, arrow key positioning, ARIA labels/screen reader support, keyboard shortcuts, focus indicators, and integration testing. Comprehensive dev notes include: keyboard navigation state machine (NAVIGATE/PAN/POSITION modes), ARIA label patterns, focus management with react-zoom-pan-pinch, keyboard shortcut implementation, WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements, file modification list (6 files to modify, 3 new hooks/components, 3 test files). Story builds on ALL Epic 1 stories (1.1-1.5) to ensure complete accessibility. Note: Draft created ahead but implementation deferred until Story 1.4 coordinate precision is complete. Next: Generate story-context for Story 1.4 (priority), then proceed with Story 1.4 implementation before returning to Story 1.6.
- **2025-10-20:** Completed story-context for Story 1.4 (Coordinate-based Location Marking in Zoomed View). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-1.4.xml.

- **2025-10-22:** Completed story-context for Story 2.2 (Create New Flare from Body Map). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-2.2.xml. Generated comprehensive implementation context including: 12 documentation artifacts (PRD FR005/FR006/NFR002, Architecture, Epics, user journeys, prerequisite stories 2.1/1.4/1.5), 11 code artifacts (flareRepository createFlare/addFlareEvent, FlareRecord/FlareEventRecord types, enums, BodyMapViewer, FlareMarkers, useFlares hook, bodyRegions data), 15 constraints (repository usage, coordinate normalization, UUID v4, offline-first, React Query cache invalidation, 44x44px touch targets), 7 interfaces (flareRepository methods, FlareRecord/FlareEventRecord schemas, Coordinates, BodyMapViewer props, useFlares hook), 11 dependencies (React 19.1.0, Next.js 15.5.4, uuid 13.0.0, Dexie 4.2.0, Zod 4.1.12, testing libraries), testing standards (Jest 30.2.0, RTL 16.3.0, fake-indexeddb), 3 test locations, 32 test ideas mapped to all 8 acceptance criteria. Context provides complete implementation guidance for FlareCreationModal component, body map integration ("Create Flare" button), real-time UI updates via React Query, success toast with actions, and offline-first error handling. Story file updated with context reference. Next: DEV agent should run `*dev-story` workflow to implement Story 2.2 using generated context.
- **2025-10-23:** Completed create-story for Story 2.3 (Active Flares Dashboard). Story file: docs/stories/story-2.3.md. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready). Story includes 7 acceptance criteria: (1) Active Flares page displays filtered list at /flares route using useFlares hook with {status: 'active'} filter, (2) Each list item displays comprehensive flare information (body region, severity with color coding, trend arrow, days active, last updated), (3) List sorted by priority with user control (default severity descending, toggle to recent updates, preference persisted to localStorage), (4) Tapping flare navigates to detail page with keyboard accessibility, (5) Empty state guides user to body map when no active flares, (6) Pull-to-refresh on mobile triggers data refresh, (7) Flare count badge displays total active flares. Detailed task breakdown with 6 major tasks and 82 subtasks. Comprehensive dev notes include complete ActiveFlareCard component code example, empty state component, pull-to-refresh hook, useFlares hook integration, file modification list (5 new files, 0 modified files, 2 test files), performance targets. Story builds on Story 2.2 (useFlares hook), Story 2.1 (flareRepository), Story 0.1 (Track navigation), Story 0.2 (empty state patterns). Next: SM agent should run story-ready to approve draft, then generate context via story-context workflow.
