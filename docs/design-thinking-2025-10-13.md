# Design Thinking Session: Pocket Symptom Tracker - Feature Completion

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Facilitator:** Steven
**Design Challenge:** Complete and refine existing features to create a fully functional, intuitive symptom tracking experience

---

## 🎯 Design Challenge

**Challenge Statement:**

People with autoimmune conditions (particularly Hidradenitis Suppurativa) need a complete, polished symptom tracking application that helps them understand their health patterns, communicate with doctors, and manage their condition effectively.

**Current State:**
- Phase 1 & 2 (MVP + HS features): 100% complete ✅
- Phase 3 (Intelligence Layer): 60% complete - analytics working but missing pattern recognition, medical reports, and advanced search
- Phase 4 (Polish & Scale): 10% complete - missing medication effectiveness analysis, customization, accessibility enhancements

**User Impact:**
Users currently have solid tracking capabilities but lack:
1. **Actionable insights** - Can't identify recurring patterns or predict flares
2. **Healthcare communication** - No way to generate PDF reports for doctors
3. **Data discovery** - Can't search through months of logged data
4. **Personalization** - Can't customize themes, track custom metrics, or tailor the experience
5. **Treatment optimization** - Can't analyze which medications are actually helping

**Success Criteria:**
- All incomplete features are fully functional, tested, and intuitive
- Users can generate insights and reports that inform treatment decisions
- The app feels polished, accessible, and personalized to individual needs
- Healthcare providers can easily understand patient data from exported reports

## 👥 EMPATHIZE: Understanding Users

### User Insights

**Direct User Feedback:**
- Users feel frustrated with the daily log: "Dang it! What the heck?"
- Users abandon the app and look for alternatives (though no clear alternative exists)
- The core tracking experience feels confusing and overwhelming

**Critical Discovery - Conceptual Model Mismatch:**

Users experience chronic illness as a **stream of events throughout the day**:
- Symptom flare at 2pm (severity 7, left armpit)
- Another flare at 8pm (severity 9, right groin)
- Trigger at lunch (ate dairy)
- Trigger at bedtime (high stress from work)
- Morning medication at 8am
- Evening medication at 9pm

But the app asks for a **daily summary** with one entry containing all data, which creates:
- **Cognitive dissonance**: "Do I average symptoms? Report the worst? List them all?"
- **Data loss**: "I had 3 flare-ups but can only describe it once"
- **Unclear workflow**: "I already logged symptoms at lunch... do I fill this out again?"

### Key Observations

**Pain Points (Overwhelming):**
1. Five sections to consider every day feels like too much
2. Unclear what's mandatory vs optional ("Do I need to fill EVERYTHING?")
3. Takes too long to complete when experiencing symptoms
4. Decision fatigue leads to abandonment

**Pain Points (Lack of Clarity):**
1. Not clear what to enter in each field or when
2. Terminology feels medical/technical rather than human
3. Missing contextual help or examples
4. Users must remember what symptoms/triggers they've pre-configured

**Workflow Mismatch:**
- The "daily summary" model doesn't match the "event stream" reality
- Users want to log things **as they happen** throughout the day, not reconstruct their day later
- Medications are time-based (8am, 9pm), not daily checkboxes
- Multiple symptom events per day need separate logging with context

### Empathy Map Summary

**SAYS** (out loud / in feedback):
- "Dang it! What the heck?"
- "This is too confusing"
- "I'm going to try a different app"

**THINKS** (internal frustration):
- "Do I have to fill out all these sections?"
- "I already logged symptoms at lunch, why is it asking again?"
- "What's the difference between 'overall health' and 'energy level'?"
- "This feels like homework, not helpful tracking"

**DOES** (actual behavior):
- Opens the app, sees the form, feels overwhelmed
- Starts filling it out, gets confused about what to enter
- Abandons mid-entry or skips sections
- Looks for alternative apps (even without knowing what they want)

**FEELS** (emotional state):
- Frustrated when in pain and faced with complex form
- Confused about what the app expects from them
- Discouraged that tracking is harder than the condition itself
- Anxious about "doing it wrong"

---

## 🎨 DEFINE: Frame the Problem

### Point of View Statement

**Primary POV (Conceptual Model):**
"People with chronic conditions need to **log health events as they happen throughout the day** because their symptoms, medications, and triggers occur at specific times with specific contexts, not as daily summaries to reconstruct later."

**Secondary POV (Cognitive Load):**
"People experiencing symptom flares need to **track their data quickly with minimal cognitive effort** because pain and brain fog make complex forms overwhelming when they most need to log information."

**Tertiary POV (Clarity & Guidance):**
"First-time symptom trackers need **clear, human-language guidance on what to log and when** because medical/technical terminology and unclear expectations cause anxiety and abandonment."

### How Might We Questions

**Event Stream Model:**
1. HMW let users log symptoms the moment they happen, without opening a full form?
2. HMW capture multiple symptom events per day with individual timestamps and context?
3. HMW show a timeline of today's events instead of a single daily summary?
4. HMW make medications feel like time-based events rather than daily checkboxes?

**Reducing Cognitive Load:**
5. HMW make logging take less than 30 seconds when a user is in pain?
6. HMW show only what's essential and hide advanced options until needed?
7. HMW guide users through what to log without overwhelming them?
8. HMW remember context so users don't have to make the same decisions daily?

**Clarity & Intuition:**
9. HMW make the app feel like a helpful friend instead of a medical form?
10. HMW use language that matches how people naturally describe their condition?
11. HMW provide just-in-time help exactly when users are confused?
12. HMW show examples of what "good tracking" looks like?

### Key Insights

**Insight 1: The Fundamental Model is Wrong**
The app's "daily summary" model conflicts with how chronic illness actually works (discrete events throughout the day). This isn't a UI problem - it's an architectural/conceptual problem that causes all downstream confusion.

**Insight 2: Speed Matters More Than Completeness**
When users are experiencing symptoms, they need to log quickly (30 seconds max). The current 5-section form prioritizes comprehensive data over speed, which fails when users need it most.

**Insight 3: Progressive Disclosure is Missing**
The form shows all sections/fields upfront, creating decision paralysis. Users need a path from "essential minimum" to "comprehensive detail" based on their energy/time.

**Insight 4: The "Quick" vs "Guided" Modes Don't Solve the Core Problem**
Having two modes addresses the symptom (complexity) but not the disease (wrong conceptual model). Users still can't log multiple discrete events throughout the day.

**Insight 5: Context is Lost in Daily Summaries**
"Symptom at 2pm after eating lunch at restaurant" is different from "symptom at 8pm before bed." Daily summaries lose this temporal and contextual richness.

**Opportunity Areas:**

1. **Rethink the data model:** Move from daily entries to timestamped event logs
2. **Instant capture:** Let users log in <30 seconds with one-tap shortcuts
3. **Progressive detail:** Start minimal, let users add detail when they have time
4. **Timeline view:** Show today as a stream of events, not a form
5. **Smart defaults:** Remember patterns and pre-fill common entries

## 💡 IDEATE: Generate Solutions

### Selected Methods

**Brainstorming** + **Analogous Inspiration** + **Provotype Thinking**

We analyzed how other apps handle event logging:
- **Papaya (HS app)**: Separate screens for symptoms, triggers, treatments, photos
- **Apple Health**: Timeline view showing "what happened when"
- Key insight: Separate entry points avoid "one giant form" problem

### Generated Ideas

**Event Logging (Theme A):**
1. Separate "Log Symptom" / "Log Trigger" / "Log Med" buttons (like Papaya)
2. Floating "+" button with quick options
3. Timeline view replaces daily form
4. Photo-first logging

**Speed & Minimal Friction (Theme B):**
5. One-tap symptom logging ("Headache Now")
6. Minimal-first logging (add details later)
7. Voice note quick capture
8. Wearable/Siri shortcuts

**Progressive Disclosure (Theme C):**
9. "Add details" button on timeline items
10. Smart prompts at end of day
11. Quick log now, elaborate later

**Guidance & Clarity (Theme D):**
12. Example cards showing good tracking
13. Contextual tooltips
14. Onboarding walkthrough

**Radical Simplification (Theme E):**
15. No forms, just chat/AI parsing

### Top Concepts

**Selected for Prototyping: Hybrid Solution (Concepts 1 + 2 + 3 Combined)**

**Concept 1: Event Stream Architecture** (Foundation)
- Replace "Daily Entry Form" with "Today's Timeline"
- Separate quick-entry buttons: "Log Symptom", "Log Trigger", "Log Med", "Add Photo"
- Each creates a timestamped event
- View today as a feed/timeline of events
- Optional end-of-day reflection/summary

**Concept 2: Lightning-Fast Symptom Capture** (Speed)
- Home screen shows favorite/recent symptoms as one-tap buttons
- Tap "Right Armpit Flare" → auto-logs with timestamp (3-5 seconds)
- Optional: Tap again to add severity/notes
- Gets logging down to minimal friction for common cases

**Concept 3: Progressive Detail Model** (Reduces Overwhelm)
- Start with bare minimum (symptom name + time)
- Timeline items show "Tap to add details" prompt
- Can elaborate later when user has energy
- End-of-day prompt: "Want to add context to today's 3 symptoms?"

**Why This Combination Works:**
- **Addresses conceptual model mismatch**: Events throughout the day, not daily summary
- **Solves speed problem**: 3-5 second logging for common cases
- **Reduces cognitive load**: Progressive disclosure, not everything at once
- **Maintains data richness**: Can still capture detailed context when desired
- **Flexible**: Quick when in pain, detailed when you have time

## 🛠️ PROTOTYPE: Make Ideas Tangible

### Prototype Approach

**Method:** Text-based user flow + Wireframe description (low-fidelity)

**Why low-fidelity?** Quick and rough beats polished at this stage. We want to test assumptions before heavy investment. Low-fi invites feedback and iteration.

**Prototype Type:** Interactive flow description showing:
- New home/dashboard screen layout
- Quick-log interaction patterns
- Timeline/event stream display
- Progressive detail addition flow

### Prototype Description

**Redesigned Home/Dashboard Screen:**

- Chronological feed shows "what happened when"

### Key Features to Test

**Speed Tests:**
1. Can users log a symptom in under 5 seconds?
2. Is one-tap logging clear and discoverable?
3. Do quick-log buttons make sense at a glance?

**Clarity Tests:**
4. Is the timeline view immediately understandable?
5. Do users know they can add details later?
6. Are the emoji icons (💊 😣 ⚠️) helpful or confusing?

**Workflow Tests:**
7. Does the event stream model match users' mental model?
8. Can users log multiple symptom events throughout the day?
9. Is it clear that end-of-day notes are optional?

**Completeness Tests:**
10. Can users still capture detailed context when needed?

## ✅ TEST: Validate with Users

### Testing Plan

**Phase 1: Conceptual Validation (Completed)**
- Walked through critical user scenarios
- Tested flows against real-world contexts
- Validated assumptions about flare behavior

**Phase 2: Expert Review (Recommended)**
- Show prototype to HS patients or healthcare professionals
- Ask: "Does this match how chronic illness works?"

**Phase 3: User Testing (Future)**
- 5-7 test participants (HS patients)
- Task-based testing: "Log a symptom/flare now"
- Observe actual behavior vs stated preferences

### User Feedback

**Scenario 1: Morning Medication (VALIDATED ✅)**
- User wakes up, takes Humira, logs via Quick Log button
- Flow: Tap Med → Select from list → See timing warning if needed → Add optional notes from recent suggestions → Save
- **Feedback:** "That seems like a good flow"
- **Enhancement identified:** Medication timing warnings + smart note suggestions

**Scenario 2: Flare Onset at Work (REFINED 🔄)**

**Initial Assumption (WRONG):**
- Flares are sudden emergencies requiring 3-second logging

**Corrected Understanding:**
- Flares have gradual onset (tingle, discomfort = warning signs)
- User has 10-15 seconds to provide context
- Body location is ESSENTIAL (not optional)
- Severity matters upfront (not progressive)
- Flares are ongoing states, not discrete events

**Refined Flow:**
- Tap "New Flare" → Select body location (body map) → Set severity slider → Optional notes → Save or Add Details
- Takes 10-15 seconds
- Creates ACTIVE flare that can be updated over time

**Key Distinction Validated:**

| Type | Speed | Required Fields | Body Map | Nature |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| **Flare** | 10-15 sec | Location + Severity | Yes | Ongoing state (update over time) |
| **Symptom** | 3-5 sec | Name only | No | Discrete event |
| **Medication** | 2-3 sec | Name + taken | No | Discrete event |
| **Trigger** | 3-5 sec | Name + intensity | No | Discrete event |

**Flare Lifecycle Validated:**
1. **Create** → Log new flare with location + initial severity
2. **Update** → Track severity changes over hours/days (5-10 sec updates)
3. **Intervene** → Log treatments (ice, meds, rest)
4. **Resolve** → Mark as resolved, capture what helped

### Key Learnings

**Learning 1: Flares ≠ General Symptoms**
Flares are HS-specific events that:
- Progress over time (not one-and-done)
- Require body location (essential context)
- Need ongoing tracking (create → update → resolve)
- Have different UI needs than general symptoms

**Learning 2: Event Stream Model Validated**
Users DO experience chronic illness as discrete events throughout the day:
- Medication at 8am (timestamped event)
- Flare update at 2pm (timestamped event)
- Trigger at dinner (timestamped event)
- NOT as a "daily summary" to reconstruct later

**Learning 3: Speed Requirements Vary by Event Type**
- Medications: 2-3 seconds (checkbox)
- General symptoms: 3-5 seconds (name only)
- Flares: 10-15 seconds (location + severity required)
- All use progressive disclosure for optional details

**Learning 4: Active State Visibility Critical**
Users need to see active flares prominently on home screen:
- Quick access to update severity
- Clear progression indicators (↑↓→ arrows)
- Easy to resolve when healed
- Don't bury in navigation

**Learning 5: Progressive Disclosure Still Applies**
Even flares use progressive disclosure:
- Essential: Location + severity (10-15 sec)
- Optional: Photos, detailed notes, triggers, interventions
- "Save" for quick capture, "Add Details" for comprehensive

**Assumptions Corrected:**
- ❌ Flares are emergencies requiring 3-sec logging
- ✅ Flares have gradual onset, 10-15 sec is acceptable
- ❌ Body location can be added later
- ✅ Body location is essential upfront
- ❌ Flares are discrete events like symptoms
- ✅ Flares are ongoing states requiring updates

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Refinements Needed

**Architecture Changes:**
1. **Event-based data model** - Move from single daily entry to timestamped event logs
2. **Active flare state management** - Track ongoing flares separately from resolved history
3. **Timeline aggregation** - Build daily timeline from multiple event types

**UI Component Updates:**
4. **Home/Dashboard redesign** - Show active flares + quick-log buttons + today's timeline
5. **Flare-specific components** - New flare flow (create/update/resolve)
6. **Quick-log modals** - Separate entry flows for each event type
7. **Timeline component** - Chronological event feed with expand/edit capabilities

**Feature Enhancements:**
8. **Medication timing warnings** - Alert if taking too early/late
9. **Smart note suggestions** - Show recent notes as templates
10. **Flare progression tracking** - Severity trends over time with visual indicators (↑↓→)
11. **Progressive detail system** - "Add details" button on timeline items

**Keep from Current Implementation:**
12. Body mapping system (works well, just integrate with quick-log flare flow)
13. Photo annotation (works well, add to "Add details" flow)
14. Trigger correlation (works well, feed from new event stream)
15. Analytics dashboard (works well, consume new event-based data)
