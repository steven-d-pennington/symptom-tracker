# Sprint Change Proposal
**Project:** Pocket Symptom Tracker - Phase 3 Intelligence Layer
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Initiated By:** Development Team (Claude Code BMAD Agent)
**Change Scope:** Moderate - Backlog Refinement Required
**Status:** APPROVED & IMPLEMENTED

---

## Section 1: Issue Summary

### Problem Statement
Story 1.1 (Trend Analysis Engine) was created with excessive scope, containing 10 major tasks representing 20-40 hours of development work. This violates BMAD story sizing best practice of 4-8 hour stories, making the story:
- Too large to complete in a single implementation session
- Difficult to test incrementally
- High risk if implementation issues arise mid-development
- Blocking potential parallel development opportunities

### Discovery Context
The issue was discovered during implementation of Story 1.1. After successfully completing Task 1 (Core Regression Algorithm) with comprehensive testing (28 tests, all passing), analysis revealed:
- Task 1 alone required significant effort (algorithm implementation + Jest configuration + comprehensive test suite)
- Remaining tasks 2-10 span multiple architectural layers (Web Workers ‚Üí Service Layer ‚Üí Database Migration ‚Üí UI Components ‚Üí Dashboard Integration ‚Üí E2E Testing)
- Story structure makes it impossible to deliver incremental value or test subsystems independently

### Evidence
- Story 1.1 documentation shows 10 tasks with 50+ subtasks
- Task 1 completion produced 4 new files and 247 lines of implementation code plus 28 comprehensive tests
- Remaining tasks include complex features: PELT algorithm for change point detection, Web Worker integration, Dexie database v5‚Üív6 migration, Chart.js component integration

## Section 2: Impact Analysis

### Epic Impact
**Epic 1: Data Analysis & Insights Engine**
- **Current State:** Defined with 7-9 stories
- **Required Change:** Expand to 11-13 stories (Story 1.1 split adds 4 stories)
- **Impact:** LOW - Same deliverables, better structure
- **Timeline Effect:** POSITIVE - Smaller stories enable faster iterations and earlier feedback

**Epic 2 & 3:** No impact - Remain unchanged

### Story Impact

**Current Stories Affected:**
- **Story 1.1:** Split into 5 sub-stories (1.1a-1.1e)
  - 1.1a: Core Regression Algorithm ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)
  - 1.1b: Service Layer & Caching (NEW - 8-12h)
  - 1.1c: Change Point Detection (NEW - 4-6h)
  - 1.1d: Visualization Components (NEW - 6-8h)
  - 1.1e: Dashboard Integration & Testing (NEW - 4-6h)

**Future Stories:** Stories 1.2-1.9 remain unchanged

### Artifact Conflicts

**PRD (`docs/PRD.md`):**
- ‚úÖ NO CONFLICT - Requirements remain valid

**Architecture (`docs/solution-architecture.md`):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR UPDATE - Should note that Trend Analysis feature is delivered across Stories 1.1a-1.1e rather than single story

**UX Spec (`docs/ux-spec.md`):**
- ‚úÖ NO CONFLICT - UI/UX specifications unchanged

**Epics (`docs/epics.md`):**
- ‚úÖ UPDATED - Story breakdown complete

**Story Files:**
- ‚úÖ UPDATED - Story 1.1 renamed to 1.1a and marked complete

### Technical Impact
- ‚úÖ **Code:** No rollback needed - Task 1 implementation remains valid
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure:** No changes needed
- ‚úÖ **Testing:** Improved - Smaller stories enable better incremental testing
- ‚úÖ **Deployment:** No impact

## Section 3: Recommended Approach

### Selected Path: Option 1 - Direct Adjustment ‚úÖ

**Approach:** Split Story 1.1 into 5 smaller, cohesive stories (1.1a-1.1e) within Epic 1

**Rationale:**
1. **Low Effort (Documentation Only):** Only requires updates to epics.md and story files - no code changes needed
2. **Low Risk:** Preserves all completed work (Task 1), maintains all original acceptance criteria
3. **Improves Team Momentum:** Smaller stories = more frequent completions = better morale and progress visibility
4. **Better Testability:** Each sub-story can be fully tested before moving to next layer
5. **Enables Parallelization:** After Story 1.1b (service layer) completes, Stories 1.1c and 1.1d could be developed in parallel
6. **Long-term Sustainability:** Establishes proper story sizing pattern for remaining Epic 1 stories (1.2-1.9)
7. **Maintains Business Value:** Delivers same features to users, just in smaller, tested increments

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Option 2: Rollback** - Rejected (would waste completed work and demotivate team)
- **Option 3: MVP Scope Reduction** - Not needed (story split doesn't change deliverables)

- Story 1.1a: Core Regression Algorithm (COMPLETE)
- Story 1.1b: Service Layer & Caching
- Story 1.1c: Change Point Detection
- Story 1.1d: Visualization Components
- Story 1.1e: Dashboard Integration & Testing

### Change #3: Total Story Count (`docs/epics.md`)
‚úÖ Updated from "18-25 stories" to "22-29 stories" with epic breakdown

### Change #4: Story File Update
‚úÖ `docs/stories/story-1.1.md` ‚Üí `docs/stories/story-1.1a.md`
‚úÖ Renamed file, updated header, marked status as Complete

## Section 5: Implementation Handoff

### Change Scope Classification
**MODERATE** - Requires backlog organization and Product Owner/Scrum Master coordination

### Handoff Plan

**Primary Responsibility:** Product Owner / Scrum Master

**Completed Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Epic breakdown updated in `docs/epics.md`
- ‚úÖ Story 1.1a marked complete and file renamed to `story-1.1a.md`

**Remaining Actions:**
- üî≤ Create Story 1.1b markdown file using Story 1.1a as template
  - File: `docs/stories/story-1.1b.md`
  - Copy structure from 1.1a, update with Tasks 2, 3, 8 details from epics.md
- üî≤ Create Story 1.1c markdown file
  - File: `docs/stories/story-1.1c.md`
  - Update with Task 4 details (Change Point Detection)
- üî≤ Create Story 1.1d markdown file
  - File: `docs/stories/story-1.1d.md`
  - Update with Tasks 5, 6, 7 details (Visualization)
- üî≤ Create Story 1.1e markdown file

  - Requires TrendAnalysisService from 1.1b
- **1.1e: Dashboard Integration & Testing** - Must complete after 1.1b, 1.1c, and 1.1d
  - Integrates all components from previous stories

### Timeline Impact
- **Original Estimate:** Story 1.1 = 20-40 hours (monolithic)
- **New Estimate:** Stories 1.1a-1.1e = 22-32 hours total
  - 1.1a: 4-6h ‚úÖ (Complete)
  - 1.1b: 8-12h
  - 1.1c: 4-6h
  - 1.1d: 6-8h
