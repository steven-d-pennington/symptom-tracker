# Epic 3.5: Production-Ready UI/UX Enhancement

**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** READY
**Estimated Stories:** 8-10
**Estimated Points:** 40-60

---

## Goal

Transform the symptom-tracker from development build to production-ready application by fixing critical UX issues, implementing essential missing features (mood/sleep tracking), and redesigning core logging workflows for improved usability.

**This epic must be completed BEFORE Epic 4 (Photo Documentation Integration) to ensure the app is production-ready for user launch.**

---

## Background

During a comprehensive UI/UX brainstorming session on 2025-10-29, critical usability issues were identified through role-playing exercises (first-time user, daily user, power user perspectives) and expert panel review. The session revealed:

1. **Empty State Crisis** - New users clicking quick action buttons hit empty states with no data, creating a critical drop-off moment
2. **Modal Pattern Cascade Failure** - Current modal-based logging causes multiple UX problems: clunky interactions, scrollable boxes, toast layout shifts, overwhelming lists
3. **Missing Essential Features** - Mood and sleep tracking are clinically essential per medical expert review
4. **Broken Functionality** - Dark mode text visibility, calendar not displaying data, outdated information

**Session Document:** `docs/brainstorming-session-results-2025-10-29.md`

## Scope

### Phase 0: Critical Fixes (This Epic)

**Top 4 Priorities:**
1. Fix empty state crisis - pre-populate defaults + contextual guidance
2. Redesign logging from modals to dedicated pages
3. Add mood & sleep basic logging
4. Fix dark mode text visibility

**Additional Critical Fixes:**
5. Remove onboarding Step 5 (learning modules don't exist)
6. Remove broken flares page buttons
7. Remove redundant log page
8. Fix calendar wiring to display data
9. Update About page
10. Dashboard button visual consistency
11. Fix toast layout shift
12. Replace info boxes with persistent "i" icons

---

## User Impact

**First-Time Users:**
- Can successfully log their first symptom/food/trigger (no empty states)
- Clear guidance when setup needed
- Smoother onboarding experience

**Daily Users:**
- Faster, less frustrating logging experience (dedicated pages vs modals)
- Can track mood and sleep (essential for correlations)
- Consistent dark mode experience
- Working calendar view

**Power Users:**
- Foundation for correlation analytics (needs mood/sleep data)
- More reliable, polished product
- Production-ready for sharing with others

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New users can successfully log data on first try (empty states resolved)
- [ ] All logging types have dedicated pages (no modals)
- [ ] Mood and sleep can be logged and viewed
- [ ] Dark mode text is readable throughout app
- [ ] Calendar displays historical data
- [ ] All broken/confusing UI elements removed
- [ ] Zero critical UX blockers remaining for production launch
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive tests
- [ ] Build passes successfully

---

## Technical Considerations

**Schema Changes Required:**
- Mood data model (mood entry, scale/picker values, timestamps)
- Sleep data model (hours slept, quality rating, timestamps)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Maintain import/export feature compatibility
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Update devdatacontrols for new schemas

**Component Changes:**
- Convert 4 modals to dedicated pages (Symptom, Food, Trigger, Medication logging)
- Create mood and sleep logging pages
- Update navigation/routing
- Fix CSS variables for dark mode
- Calendar data integration

**Repository Pattern:**
- Extend repositories for mood and sleep data
- Follow existing patterns from flare/symptom repositories
- Offline-first IndexedDB persistence

---

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Epic 4 (Photo Documentation) - Cannot launch photos until core UX is production-ready
- Phase 1 MVP (Customizable Dashboard) - Planned for future epic
- Correlation Analytics - Requires mood/sleep data from this epic

**Depends On:**
- Epic 3 completion ✅ (completed 2025-10-29)
- No other blockers
