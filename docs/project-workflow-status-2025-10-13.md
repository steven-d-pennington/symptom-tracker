### Next Action Required

**What to do next:** Implement Epic 2 Stories (2.1 through 2.7)

**Command to run:** Run 'dev-story' workflow to implement Epic 2 UI Components & Quick-Log System

**Agent to load:** bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md

**Priority Stories:**
- Story 2.1: QuickLog Buttons Component (has context)
- Story 2.2: Active Flare Cards Component (has context)
- Story 2.3: Timeline View Component (has context)
- Story 2.4: Flare Creation and Update Modals (has context)
- Story 2.5: Medication, Symptom, and Trigger Log Modals (has context)
- Story 2.7: Mobile Responsive Design and Accessibility (has context)

**Note:** All Epic 2 stories now have context files ready. Story 2.6 (Event Detail Modal) context can be generated when needed, or stories 2.1-2.5 can be implemented first.

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** web (Web Application)
- **Project Level:** 2
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-med.md (Level 2 - Medium project with multiple epics)
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** brownfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Medium-sized web application project (Level 2)
- **Estimated Stories:** 5-15 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2 epics
- **Timeline:** To be determined during planning

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** Yes - Good documentation exists
- **Team Size:** Individual developer
- **Deployment Intent:** To be determined

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 2 (Planning):**
- PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Epics breakdown
- Story backlog (5-15 stories)
- UX Specification (user flows, wireframes, component specs)

**Phase 4 (Implementation):**
- Story files (drafted and implemented)
- Context XML files per story
- Working code delivered

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Phase 2 - Planning**
   - Run `plan-project` (PM agent) ‚Üí Generate PRD with epics and stories
   - Run `ux-spec` (PM agent) ‚Üí Create UX/UI specification

2. **Phase 4 - Implementation** (Iterative)
   - Run `create-story` (SM agent) ‚Üí Draft next story
   - Run `story-ready` (SM agent) ‚Üí Approve story for development
   - Run `story-context` (SM agent) ‚Üí Generate context XML
   - Run `dev-story` (DEV agent) ‚Üí Implement story
   - Run `story-approved` (DEV agent) ‚Üí Mark story complete
   - Repeat until all stories complete

### Next Actions

**Immediate Next Step:**
1. Load DEV agent
2. Run `dev-story` workflow for Story 2.1 (QuickLog Buttons)
3. Implement component using docs/stories/story-context-2.1.xml as guidance

## Special Considerations

- **UI Components:** Project has user-facing UI - UX workflow included
- **Documentation:** Brownfield project with good existing documentation - can leverage for planning
- **Level 2 Scope:** Focus on 1-2 coherent epics, keep story count between 5-15
- **No Phase 3:** Level 2 projects skip solutioning phase - go directly from planning to implementation

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Web application (likely React/Next.js based on existing codebase structure)
- TypeScript codebase
- Database: Likely SQL-based (to be confirmed in PRD)

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 2 (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `C:\projects\symptom-tracker\docs\stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md (5-15 total for Level 2)

## Decision Log

### Planning Decisions Made

- **2025-10-13 (Morning)**: Initial workflow-status assessment completed. Determined brownfield web application with UI components, Level 2 scope (medium project). Skipping Phase 1 (Analysis) - user knows what to build. Including UX workflow due to UI components. Planning to route through Phase 2 (Planning) ‚Üí Phase 4 (Implementation). Phase 3 (Solutioning) not required for Level 2.

- **2025-10-13 (Afternoon)**: Event Stream Redesign planning completed. Created PRD and epics for fundamental architecture change from daily summary to event stream model. Key decisions: (1) Zero users = clean slate schema redesign (no migration), (2) 8-10 week timeline, (3) 12-17 stories across 3 epics, (4) Speed as primary goal (2-15 sec logging vs 2-5 min), (5) Repurpose daily log as optional reflection. Ready to begin Epic 1 (Database Schema) implementation.

- **2025-10-14**: Story 2.1 (QuickLog Buttons Component) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS. Next story 2.2 (Active Flare Cards Component) moved from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO. Phase 4 implementation tracking structure created. Epic 1 completed (5/5 stories). Beginning Epic 2 UI implementation.
- **2025-10-14 (Evening)**: Generated story-context XML for Story 2.1, updated status file, and handed off to DEV agent to run `dev-story` using docs/stories/story-context-2.1.xml. Overall progress nudged to 31%.
- **2025-10-14 (Night)**: Story 2.2 (Active Flare Cards Component) approved for development. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS, promoted Story 2.3 (Timeline View Component) from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO, and refreshed next actions for story-context.
- **2025-10-14 (Late Night)**: Completed story-context workflow for Story 2.2. Generated comprehensive context XML at docs/stories/story-context-2.2.xml including all artifacts (docs, code references), constraints (architecture, UI patterns, accessibility), interfaces (repository methods, types), and test guidance. Progress nudged to 33%. Ready for DEV agent to implement ActiveFlareCards component.
- **2025-10-14 (Late Night)**: Story 2.3 (Timeline View Component) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS. Next story 2.4 (Flare Creation and Update Modals) moved from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO.
- **2025-10-14 (Pre-Dawn)**: Story 2.4 (Flare Creation and Update Modals) approved for development. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS, promoted Story 2.5 (Medication, Symptom, and Trigger Log Modals) from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO, and refreshed next actions for story-context.
- **2025-10-14 (Early Morning)**: Story 2.5 (Medication, Symptom, and Trigger Log Modals) approved for development. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS, promoted Story 2.6 (Event Detail Modal) from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO, and set up next action for story-context.
- **2025-10-14 (Pre-Dawn)**: Completed story-context workflow for Story 2.3. Generated comprehensive context XML at docs/stories/story-context-2.3.xml including timeline aggregation logic, repository interfaces, date grouping patterns, pagination strategy, and test ideas. Progress nudged to 36%. Ready for DEV agent to implement TimelineView component.
- **2025-10-14 (Early Morning)**: Completed story-context workflow for Story 2.4. Generated comprehensive context XML at docs/stories/story-context-2.4.xml including FlareCreationModal and FlareUpdateModal specifications, BodyMapViewer integration patterns, severity slider implementation, auto-detection logic, form validation, responsive design constraints, and 19 detailed test ideas. Progress nudged to 38%. Ready for DEV agent to implement both modal components.
- **2025-10-14 (Morning)**: Completed story-context workflow for Story 2.5. Generated context XML covering medication, symptom, and trigger quick-log modals with repository integrations, smart notes, UX constraints, and testing guidance. Progress increased to 40%. DEV agent now unblocked to start dev-story workflows.
- **2025-10-14 (Morning)**: Story 2.6 (Event Detail Modal for Progressive Disclosure) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS. Next story 2.7 (Mobile Responsive Design and Accessibility) moved from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO.
- **2025-10-14**: Story 2.7 (Mobile Responsive Design and Accessibility) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS. Next story 3.1 (Redesign Home/Dashboard Page) moved from BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO.
- **2025-10-14 (Mid-Morning)**: Completed story-context workflow for Story 2.7. Generated comprehensive context XML at docs/stories/story-context-2.7.xml covering mobile responsive design patterns (full-screen modals <768px, 44px tap targets, thumb-zone optimization) and accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, semantic HTML, screen reader testing). Context includes 5 documentation references, 8 code references to Epic 2 components, 5 interface patterns, and 12 detailed test ideas. Progress nudged to 43%. All Epic 2 stories (2.1-2.5, 2.7) now have context ready for DEV agent implementation.
