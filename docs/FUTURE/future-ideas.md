# Future Enhancement Ideas

## Infrastructure & Multi-User
- Use UUID for userId to help with future cloud syncs
- Allow multiple users on a device
- Fully offline capable

## Logging UX
When logging, by default the logging modal only shows favorites. User starts typing and matches appear below. If no matches a plus sign appears and you can add the item which will become a custom item and automatically a favorite on save.

## Body Map Enhancements
- **Body Map Layers** - See detailed proposal in `body-map-layers.md`
  - Track multiple condition types (flares, pain, mobility, inflammation)
  - Layer-specific markers with distinct visual styles
  - View all layers or filter to single layer
  - Persistent layer selection for streamlined tracking
