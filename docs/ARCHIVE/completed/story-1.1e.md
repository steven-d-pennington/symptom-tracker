## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Dashboard Architecture:**
- Container/Presenter pattern for dashboard component
- Widget-based architecture for modularity
- Centralized state management (React Context)
- Error boundaries for fault isolation

**State Management:**
- Dashboard state includes: selected metric, time range, analysis results, loading state, error state
- Use React Context to avoid prop drilling
- Service calls managed with useEffect hooks
- Cache state managed by AnalysisRepository

**Error Handling:**
- Error boundaries catch component errors
- Service errors displayed with user-friendly messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Fallback UI for unavailable features

**Performance Requirements (NFR2):**
- <2 seconds for 90-day datasets (enforced by tests)
- <5 seconds for full historical analysis (1+ years)
- Loading skeletons prevent perceived lag
- Web Worker prevents UI blocking

**Accessibility Requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA):**
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators visible and distinct
- Alternative text for charts and icons

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Files to Create:**
```
/src/components/analytics/
  AnalyticsDashboard.tsx               # Main dashboard component (placeholder)
  DashboardContext.tsx                 # Dashboard state management

/src/app/analytics/
  page.tsx                             # Analytics page route (Next.js App Router)

/tests/e2e/
  analytics-dashboard.spec.ts          # Playwright E2E tests

/tests/performance/
  trend-analysis-performance.test.ts   # Performance test suite

/tests/accessibility/
  analytics-accessibility.test.ts      # Accessibility test suite
```

**Modified Files:**
```
/src/components/navigation/MainNav.tsx           # Add analytics menu item
/src/lib/services/TrendAnalysisService.ts        # Add any missing methods for integration
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified-project-structure.md:**
- Components in `/src/components/analytics`
- Next.js pages in `/src/app/analytics`
- E2E tests in `/tests/e2e`
- Performance tests in `/tests/performance`

**Next.js App Router:**
- Use App Router convention: `/src/app/analytics/page.tsx`
- Server components where possible for performance
- Client components for interactive widgets

**Testing Structure:**
- Unit tests: Colocated with components
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration`
- E2E tests: `/tests/e2e`
- Performance tests: `/tests/performance`
- Accessibility tests: `/tests/accessibility`

**Naming Conventions:**
- Components: PascalCase with `.tsx` extension
- Pages: `page.tsx` (Next.js convention)
- Tests: `[feature].spec.ts` or `[feature].test.ts`

### Testing Standards Summary

- State management (Context provider)
- Error boundary behavior
- Loading state transitions

**Integration Testing:**
- Dashboard → Service → Repository → Database flow
- Cache behavior (hit/miss/invalidation)
- Error recovery and retry logic

**E2E Testing (Playwright):**
- User flow: Navigate to analytics → select metric → view chart
- Time range selection
- Error scenarios (no data)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsive testing

**Performance Testing:**
- Computation time for various dataset sizes
- Assert <2s for 90-day datasets

- Load testing with 1800+ entries (5 years)
- Web Worker offloading verification
