# Story 1.2: Pre-populated Food Database with Allergen Tags

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2025-10-16)

## Story

As a user,
I want to select from a pre-populated database of common foods with allergen information,
so that I can log food quickly without typing and get accurate allergen correlation data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Database includes 200+ common foods with names organized by category (breakfast items, proteins, vegetables, fruits, grains, etc.)
2. Each food tagged with relevant allergens (dairy, gluten, nuts, shellfish, nightshades, soy, eggs, fish) aligned with medical standards
3. Foods searchable by name using full-text search across the IndexedDB-backed catalog
4. Foods categorized for filtering (breakfast items, proteins, vegetables, fruits, grains, snacks, etc.)
5. Allergen tags visually indicated with consistent color coding matching existing design system
6. Database seeded at app initialization using Dexie migration (idempotent, version 11)
7. Foods stored in IndexedDB for offline access with compound indexes for efficient queries
8. FoodLogModal (created in Story 1.1) wired to display real food data instead of placeholders
9. Search functionality in FoodLogModal filters foods by name in real-time
10. Favorites grid in FoodLogModal displays most recently or frequently used foods

## Dev Notes

This story implements the database foundation and wires real data into the FoodLogModal created in Story 1.1. It follows the local-first architecture with IndexedDB persistence via Dexie, reusing established repository patterns from symptoms, medications, and triggers.

**Key Architecture Patterns:**
- **Repository Pattern:** `foodRepository` and `foodEventRepository` follow the same CRUD interface as existing repositories (symptomRepository, medicationRepository), with compound indexes for efficient queries.
- **JSON String Storage:** Arrays stored as JSON strings in IndexedDB (allergenTags, foodIds, photoIds) per existing convention - must parse on read.
- **Soft Deletes:** Use `isActive` flag for foods and `deletedAt` timestamp for events to maintain audit trail.
- **Dexie Versioning:** Version 11 migration adds new tables; seed service uses sentinel check to ensure idempotent execution.
- **Context Pattern:** FoodContext extended with Dexie liveQuery subscriptions for reactive updates, matching DashboardContext patterns.

**Performance Targets:**
- Food search: <250ms for 200+ items (use compound indexes first, then in-memory filtering)
- Modal save: <500ms (existing requirement from Story 1.1, now includes database write)
- Seed operation: <2 seconds for 200+ foods (batch inserts in chunks of 50)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for repositories with mock Dexie (follow `symptomRepository.test.ts` patterns)
- Component tests for FoodLogModal with mocked repository
- Integration tests for full save flow
- Performance tests validating timing requirements
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage across all new files

**Database Integration:**
- Reuse existing Dexie instance from `src/lib/db/client.ts`
- Follow migration patterns from existing versions (see version 9 symptom migration)
- Ensure compatibility with existing data (no breaking changes to other tables)
