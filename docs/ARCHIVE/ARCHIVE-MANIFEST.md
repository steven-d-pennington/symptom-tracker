## 2025-11-16 Major Cleanup Summary

**Motivation:** Post-Epic 9 completion cleanup. Project updated through BMAD alpha.0 → alpha.10, requiring terminology updates and archive organization for "clean slate" foundation.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated PRD and Architecture headers (Level 2 → track: method)
- ✅ Archived 6 Epic 9 planning/investigation files
- ✅ Archived legacy workflow status markdown (superseded by YAML)
- ✅ Moved 4 implementation notes from docs root to implementation-findings/
- ✅ Archived 2 past audit reports
- ✅ Archived 3 technical analysis files
- ✅ Archived Epic 3 retrospective to completed-epics/
- ✅ Removed empty retrospectives/ directory
- ✅ Updated ARCHIVE-MANIFEST.md (18 → 37 files)

**Result:** Docs root reduced from ~27 files to ~13 core files. Clean foundation for future feature iterations.
