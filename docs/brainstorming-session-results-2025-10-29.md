## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: Role Playing (Collaborative) - 20 minutes

**Objective:** Generate solutions from multiple stakeholder perspectives to ensure comprehensive consideration of all user viewpoints.

#### First-Time User Perspective

**Pain Points Identified:**
1. **Onboarding Step 5 Confusion:** "Quick learning modules" with "Reviewed" checkbox is misleading when there's nothing to actually review - should be removed until learning modules exist
2. **Dashboard Visual Inconsistency:** 5 colorful big buttons clash with rest of app's design aesthetic - quick actions need to be prominent but visually cohesive
3. **Empty State Dead End:** Clicking quick action buttons (Food, Symptoms, Triggers, Medication) shows no options - critical drop-off moment

**Solutions Generated:**
- Pre-populate sensible defaults at user creation
- Implement guided walkthrough for adding/customizing items and setting favorites
- Add contextual help: "Looks like you need to add some symptoms first. Want to do that now?"
- Empty states need clear guidance/links to setup areas (Settings or Manage Data)

#### Daily Active User Perspective

**Friction Points Across App:**

**Flare Tracking Modal Issues:**
- Body map not centered in modal
- Body regions should expand/zoom when clicked for precise location selection
- Left/right views are non-functional
- Keyboard shortcuts (f,b,l,r) conflict with text input in description field - need to disable when typing
- Details section in scrollable box is confusing to navigate
- Mobile: Marker placement inaccurate (goes to region edge, not touch point)

**Log Symptom Modal Issues:**
- Overwhelming display of all symptoms at once
- Mini form opening behavior feels awkward
- Toast messages push content causing jarring layout shifts

**Log Food/Trigger Modal Issues:**
- Without favorites, seeing ALL items makes modal unusable
- Need collapsible categories with smart defaults: Favorites expanded → Recents → Collapsed categories
- Custom items should appear at top
- Settings should allow disabling default items (apply to symptoms and triggers too)

**Dark Mode Issues:**
- Text visibility broken - dark text on dark backgrounds throughout app

**Missing Features:**
- No clear place to log Mood & Sleep
- Proposed: Repurpose log page as "Sleep & Mood" page
- Unclear where mood/sleep data is tracked and analyzed

**Analytics Page Issues:**
- Possibly overlooked/replaced by flare analytics only
- Should be dedicated navigation item serving as analytics hub
- Should link to all analytics pages (symptoms, food, triggers, flares, sleep, mood, etc.)

**Calendar:**
- Completely out of sync, nothing displaying - needs complete rewiring

**About Page:**
- Outdated information needs updating

#### Power User Perspective

**Advanced Needs:**

**Flares Page Refinements:**
- Remove "Explore map view" and "Show split layout" buttons at top
- Info boxes don't persist close state - keep reappearing after dismissal
- Solution: Persistent close preference + small "i" icon for re-access when needed

**Missing Advanced Analytics:**
- Sleep analytics (tracking and insights)
- Mood analytics (patterns over time)
- **Correlation Analysis:** The critical need - understanding relationships between sleep/food/mood/symptoms/triggers/flares

**Mobile Experience Note:**
- Multiple mobile-specific issues identified throughout session
- Significant mobile optimization work needed across entire app

**Total Ideas Generated from Role Playing: 24 distinct improvements**

### Technique 2: Assumption Reversal (Deep Analysis) - 20 minutes

**Objective:** Challenge and flip core assumptions to rebuild from new foundations - essential for paradigm shifts and fresh perspectives.

#### Assumptions Challenged & Insights Generated

**Assumption 1: "Quick action buttons need to be first view"**

**REVERSAL INSIGHT:** Users should be able to decide what's on their dashboard

**Solutions:**
- **Customizable Dashboard:** Let users configure their landing experience based on priorities
- **New User Setup Wizard:** Simple wizard asking "What's most important to you?" then configures dashboard accordingly
- Dashboard options could include: quick actions, analytics/correlations, recent entries, reminders/streaks, insights/patterns, today's summary
- Smart defaults that adapt over time based on usage patterns
- Dashboard becomes user-configured rather than prescriptive

**Assumption 2: "Local-first is a major factor"**

**REVERSAL INSIGHT:** Validates architectural decision, but reveals need for optional cloud-sync

**Solutions:**
- Maintain local-first architecture (validated as correct approach)
- **Elevate Cloud-Sync Priority:** Add optional encrypted cloud sync for users who want cross-device access
- Best of both worlds: Privacy-focused local storage with convenience of cloud backup

**Assumption 3: "Logging should happen in modals"**

**REVERSAL INSIGHT:** Different logging types need different UX patterns based on complexity

**Solutions:**
- **Simple Logs (Symptom, Food, Trigger, Medication, Mood, Sleep):** Dedicated pages instead of modals
- **Quick Log Mode:** Capture essentials with prominent "Add Details" option to expand to full form
- **Complex Logs (Flares):** Specialized interface due to body mapping interaction needs

**Flare Quick Log - Redesigned Flow:**
1. Body map first (full attention, no competing form fields)
2. User selects region → auto-zoom → marks precise spot
3. Capture severity + optional description
4. "Add Details" button for full logging if needed

**Benefits:** Solves clunky modal issues, better mobile interaction, supports both quick and detailed logging

**Dashboard Quick Access:**
- Dashboard buttons (if user keeps them) → Open simplified quick log flow
- Bottom navigation for always-accessible logging
- FAB (Floating Action Button) exploration for mobile
- User controls how much detail to log

**Assumption 4: "Calendar should display logged entries"**

**REVERSAL INSIGHT:** Calendar can be a powerful intelligence and planning tool

**Calendar Reimagined - Multi-Mode View:**
1. **Historical Mode:** Display logged entries (original intent)
2. **Predictive Mode:** "Based on patterns, you might experience X tomorrow" - uses correlation data to anticipate issues
3. **Planning Mode:** "Schedule what you want to track" - proactive tracking reminders and goals
4. **Pattern Matching Mode:** Days with pattern correlations highlighted for visual pattern recognition

**Impact:** Transforms calendar from passive log viewer into active intelligence tool - potential killer feature

**Total New Ideas from Assumption Reversal: 8 major design shifts**

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

**Critical Discoveries:**

1. **Empty State Crisis** - New users clicking quick action buttons hit empty states with no options - a critical drop-off moment that blocks core functionality. Pre-populated defaults and guided setup are essential, not optional.

2. **Modal Pattern Cascade Failure** - The modal approach is causing cascading UX problems across the entire app: clunky interactions, scrollable boxes, toast layout shifts, overwhelming lists. Different logging types need different UX patterns matched to their complexity.

3. **Correlations Are The Holy Grail** - Across all user perspectives, the desire for understanding relationships emerged repeatedly. Users don't just want to see their data - they want to understand causation: "Does my sleep affect symptoms?" "Do certain foods trigger flares?" Intelligence and insights matter more than data entry.

4. **Evolution From Tracker to Platform** - The app has potential to evolve from simple "symptom tracker" to comprehensive "health intelligence platform" that integrates with healthcare ecosystem (doctors, insurance, research). This positions it as essential healthcare tool, not just personal tracker.

5. **User Perspective Power** - The breakthrough insight came from role-playing as different user types. Stepping into first-time, daily, and power user shoes revealed friction points and needs that aren't visible from the developer perspective. Empathy-driven design reveals what analytics can't show.

6. **Customization Over Prescription** - Users should control their experience (dashboard layout, logging detail level, feature activation) rather than being forced into one-size-fits-all UX. Power comes from flexibility.

## Action Planning

### Top 4 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Fix Empty State Crisis

**Rationale:**
Unanimous #1 from expert panel. New users clicking quick action buttons hit empty states with no options - critical drop-off moment blocking core functionality.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create default data sets for symptoms, foods, triggers, medications
2. Populate these defaults on user creation (database seeding on signup)
3. Add empty state components with contextual help: "No symptoms yet. Add your first symptom in Settings > Manage Data"
4. Consider guided setup flow: "Let's add your first symptom" with link to management page
5. Test first-time user flow from signup to first successful log

**Resources Needed:**
- Database migration for default data
- Empty state UI components
- Possibly new setup wizard component
- QA testing with fresh accounts

**Timeline:** 3-5 days (depends on setup wizard complexity)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Maintain import/export feature compatibility when making schema changes. Update devdatacontrols accordingly.**

**Rationale:**
Strategic priority that solves multiple cascading problems: clunky interactions, scrollable boxes, toast layout shifts, overwhelming lists. Modal pattern is causing cascade failures across the app.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create dedicated pages for: Symptom logging, Food logging, Trigger logging, Medication logging
2. Design quick log mode with "Add Details" expansion
3. Implement collapsible categories for food/triggers with smart defaults (favorites → recents → collapsed)
4. Update navigation to link to these pages
5. Remove modal components and update dashboard buttons to navigate to pages
6. Fix toast messages to not push content (absolute positioning or toast container)

**Resources Needed:**
- New page components for each logging type
- Routing updates
- Navigation redesign
- Extensive testing across all logging types
- Mobile responsive design for each page

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (significant refactor)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Maintain import/export feature compatibility when making schema changes. Update devdatacontrols accordingly.**
