# Epic 3 Retrospective - Flare Analytics and Problem Areas

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Facilitator:** Scrum Master
**Participants:** Product Manager, Dev Agent, Testing/QA, Senior Developer
**Epic Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (5/5 stories, 100% delivery)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 3 delivered a complete analytics dashboard in 2 days with exceptional velocity (50 story points) and quality (zero defects, comprehensive test coverage). All 5 stories met acceptance criteria, builds passed, and code reviews approved with zero action items. The team demonstrated architectural excellence through consistent patterns and parallel development practices.

**Key Achievement:** Transformed raw flare data into actionable insights through Problem Areas identification, regional analysis, duration/severity metrics, trend visualization, and intervention effectiveness tracking.

## Part 1: Epic 3 Review Discussion

### üéØ Successes and Strengths

**1. Architectural Consistency (HIGH IMPACT)**
- Story 3.1 established the pattern: `analyticsRepository` ‚Üí `useAnalytics` hook ‚Üí responsive components
- Pattern replicated across all 5 stories with zero deviation
- Parallel data fetching with Promise.all improved performance (5 datasets loaded concurrently)
- Result: Predictable, maintainable codebase that scales

**2. Test-Driven Quality (HIGH IMPACT)**
- Comprehensive testing on Story 3.1 created quality baseline
- Test coverage cascaded through Epic 3 (25 ‚Üí 33 ‚Üí 51 tests)
- Caught critical bugs early (event type mismatch in Story 3.5)
- Zero regressions as complexity increased

**3. Code Review Excellence (HIGH IMPACT)**
- Story 3.2 senior developer review: 7 ACs met, 0 action items
- `useRegionAnalytics` perfectly mirrored `useAnalytics` pattern
- Demonstrated architectural maturity and design consistency

**4. Velocity and Execution (HIGH IMPACT)**
- 50 story points in 2 days (25 points/day average)
- Every story completed with all ACs met, builds passing, tests green
- No half-finished work, no technical debt deferral
- Exceptional execution discipline

**5. User-Centered Feature Design (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
- Analytics dashboard answers three core user questions:
  1. What's wrong? (Problem Areas)
  2. Is it getting better? (Trends)
  3. What helps? (Interventions)
- Coherent feature set, not isolated capabilities
- Medical disclaimer (Story 3.5) shows ethical consideration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and Growth Areas

**1. Performance Complexity (MEDIUM RISK)**
- Story 3.5's 48-hour window logic required nested loops (O(n*m))
- Algorithm handles <1000 flares but could degrade at scale
- Mitigation: Documented as technical debt, optimization deferred
- Learning: Consider performance implications during design phase

**2. Build Error in Story 3.5 (LOW IMPACT)**
- Used wrong event type ('status_update' instead of 'severity_update')
- User caught error immediately during build
- Root cause: String literal not caught by TypeScript compiler
- Mitigation: Add pre-commit type checking (action item)

**3. Missing Context Files (LOW IMPACT)**
- Story 3.1 lacked epic context file or tech spec
- Not blocking due to comprehensive story documentation
- Could have helped with architectural overview
- Mitigation: Require context files before story start (action item)

**4. Late Ethical Consideration (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
- Medical disclaimer (Story 3.5) addressed during implementation, not planning
- Should proactively consider user safety in story design phase
- Mitigation: Add "User Safety Considerations" to story template (action item)

**5. Component Coupling Risk (LOW IMPACT)**
- Time range selector shared across 4 analytics sections
- Good for UX consistency, but changes affect multiple features
- Need careful testing when modifying shared components

### üí° Insights and Learning

**1. Upfront Architectural Investment Pays Dividends**
- Story 3.1 architectural foundation enabled rapid Stories 3.2-3.5 development
- Pattern consistency reduces cognitive load, accelerates implementation
- **Apply to Epic 4:** Establish core patterns in Story 4.1 (PhotoRepository, photo components)

**2. Test Coverage on Foundation = Force Multiplication**
- Comprehensive Story 3.1 tests created confidence for subsequent features
- Adding features on tested foundation is lower risk
- **Apply to Epic 4:** Test-first approach on Story 4.1 (photo storage, compression)

**3. Chart.js Reusability Opportunity**
- Stories 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 used similar Chart.js configurations
- Should extract common chart configs into utilities
- **Apply to Epic 4:** Create shared chart utilities before Story 4.2 (photo timeline)

**4. Complete User Workflows > Isolated Features**
- Analytics value comes from complete journey (identify ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí act)
- **Apply to Epic 4:** Design photo features as complete workflow, not isolated capabilities

**5. Team Rhythm and Communication**
- Zero blockers, 100% delivery shows team hitting stride
- Codebase knowledge deep, patterns established, communication tight
- **Maintain in Epic 4:** Continue retrospective practices, pattern documentation

## Part 2: Epic 4 Preparation Discussion

### üîó Dependencies and Continuity

**Dependencies on Epic 3:**
- ‚úÖ Minimal - Epic 4 photos attach to FlareRecord from Epic 2
- ‚úÖ Analytics dashboard (Epic 3) independent from photo features
- ‚úÖ Clean architectural separation

**Integration Opportunities (Non-Blocking):**
- Story 3.2 per-region pages could integrate photo timeline views (future enhancement)
- Story 3.5 intervention effectiveness could use photos as supporting evidence (future)

**Verified Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ FlareRecord schema from Story 2.1 stable
- ‚úÖ Flare detail view (Story 2.3) ready for extension
- ‚úÖ No blocking dependencies on Epic 3 work

### üõ†Ô∏è Readiness and Setup Needs

**Photo Storage Strategy:**
- IndexedDB blob storage (browsers support 50MB-1GB quotas)
- Image compression required (raw phone photos 5-10MB each)
- Thumbnail generation for timeline views (300x300 recommended)
- MIME type handling (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)

**Technical Spikes Required:**
- `browser-image-compression` library validation (2 hours)
- Compression ratio testing (quality 0.8 vs 0.9)
- Browser compatibility verification

**File Upload UX:**
- Drag-and-drop for desktop
- Camera access for mobile (getUserMedia API)
- File picker fallback
- Upload progress indicators
- Error handling (oversized files, unsupported formats)

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Alt text fields (user-provided or auto-generated)
- Keyboard navigation for photo galleries
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Screen reader support for image galleries

**Schema Changes:**
- Add `photoIds: string[]` field to FlareRecord
- Migration strategy for existing flares (default empty array)
- Photo deletion cascade logic

### ‚ö° Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1: Scope Creep (HIGH)**
- **Concern:** Users want editing, filters, cropping, rotation
- **Mitigation:**
  - Write explicit "Out of Scope" sections in ACs
  - Story 4.4 limited to "simple annotation" only
  - User testing after Story 4.1 to validate MVP
  - Defer advanced features to backlog

**Risk 2: Performance (HIGH)**
- **Concern:** 10-20 high-res photos tank page load times
- **Mitigation:**
  - Lazy loading / virtualization for timeline views
  - Thumbnail-first loading strategy
  - Lighthouse CI performance budget (score >= 90, TTI <= 3s)
  - Mobile device testing (low-end Android)
- **Early Warning Signs:**
  - Lighthouse score < 90
  - TTI > 3 seconds
  - Mobile frame rates < 30fps
  - IndexedDB queries > 100ms

**Risk 3: Privacy (MEDIUM)**
- **Concern:** Photos contain EXIF metadata (GPS, device info)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strip sensitive EXIF data on upload
  - Implement before Story 4.1 starts
  - Document photo deletion cascade (orphaned data cleanup)

**Risk 4: UX Complexity in Story 4.3 (MEDIUM)**
- **Concern:** Before/after comparison flow unclear
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prototype comparison UI in Figma before implementation
  - User testing on comparison interaction patterns
  - Clear AC for selection flow (modal vs split view)

### üöÄ Quick Wins and De-risking

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Spike: Image compression** (2 hours, de-risks Story 4.1 immediately)
2. **PhotoRepository interface stub** (creates clear contract for Story 4.1)
3. **FileUpload component** (reusable across multiple stories)
4. **User research** (understand "why photos" to prioritize features)
