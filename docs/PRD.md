# symptom-tracker Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** BMad User
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Project Level:** Level 3 (Full Product)
**Project Type:** Web application (Progressive Web App)
**Target Scale:** Phase 3 Intelligence Layer - 18-25 stories across 3 epics

---

## Description, Context and Goals

### Description

Phase 3 introduces the Intelligence Layer to the Pocket Symptom Tracker - a comprehensive suite of analytics, search, and reporting capabilities that transforms raw health data into actionable insights. This phase empowers users and their healthcare providers to identify patterns, understand triggers, predict flares, and make data-driven decisions about treatment and lifestyle modifications.

Building on the solid foundation of Phase 1 (core symptom tracking, daily entries, calendar navigation) and Phase 2 (HS-specific features including body mapping, photo documentation, and active flare management), Phase 3 adds the intelligence needed to answer critical questions:

- **What patterns exist in my symptoms?** Advanced analytics identify trends, correlations, and seasonal patterns
- **What triggers should I avoid?** Trigger correlation analysis reveals cause-and-effect relationships
- **When will my next flare occur?** Predictive modeling provides early warning systems
- **How effective are my treatments?** Medication and intervention effectiveness analysis
- **How do I communicate this to my doctor?** Professional medical reports for consultations

The Intelligence Layer maintains the application's core privacy-first philosophy - all analysis, search indexing, and report generation happens locally on the user's device with no cloud dependencies or external data transmission.

### Deployment Intent

This is a **progressive feature rollout** for an existing production-ready PWA. Phase 3 will be deployed incrementally as features are completed, allowing users to benefit from intelligence capabilities as soon as they're stable. The rollout follows a privacy-first, offline-capable architecture with:

- Gradual feature enablement (analytics first, then search, then reports)
- User opt-in for advanced features
- No breaking changes to Phase 1 & 2 functionality
- Continuous dogfooding and refinement based on solo developer insights

### Context

People living with autoimmune conditions like Hidradenitis Suppurativa face a persistent challenge: their symptoms are highly variable, influenced by dozens of potential triggers (diet, stress, weather, hormones, sleep), and follow complex patterns that are difficult to discern without systematic analysis. While Phases 1 and 2 have equipped users with robust data collection capabilities—daily symptom logs, body mapping, photo documentation, trigger tracking, and flare management—this rich historical dataset remains largely untapped. Users currently must manually review their calendar to spot patterns, rely on memory to identify triggers, and struggle to communicate the full scope of their condition to healthcare providers who have limited appointment time. The result is prolonged suffering as users conduct trial-and-error experiments with lifestyle changes, delayed treatment adjustments, and missed opportunities for early intervention.

Phase 3 addresses this gap by transforming passive data storage into active intelligence. With months or years of symptom data now accumulated by early adopters, the timing is ideal to layer on analytics that reveal what the data is telling them. The local-first architecture means users can perform sophisticated statistical analysis—correlation matrices, trend detection, predictive modeling—entirely on their device without compromising privacy. This intelligence layer turns the symptom tracker from a record-keeping tool into a decision support system, empowering users to make informed choices about their health while giving healthcare providers concrete, data-backed insights during consultations. The need is immediate: users are already asking "what does my data mean?" and "how can I share this with my doctor?"

### Goals

1. **Pattern Discovery** - Enable users to identify symptom patterns, trigger correlations, and seasonal trends with 90%+ confidence intervals, reducing trial-and-error in managing their condition

2. **Clinical Communication** - Provide professional-grade medical reports that facilitate productive healthcare provider consultations, improving treatment outcomes through data-driven discussions

3. **Proactive Health Management** - Deliver predictive insights and early warning systems that help users anticipate and prevent flare-ups before they occur

4. **Data Accessibility** - Implement sub-second search across all health records, making any piece of information instantly findable when needed

5. **Privacy-Preserved Intelligence** - Maintain 100% local data processing with zero cloud dependencies while delivering enterprise-grade analytics capabilities

10. **Save Search** - Chen saves this search configuration as "Severe Flare Investigation" for future reference

## UX Design Principles

1. **Progressive Intelligence Disclosure** - Reveal advanced analytics features progressively based on data maturity (e.g., trend analysis unlocks at 14 days, seasonal patterns at 6 months), preventing overwhelm while educating users on what's possible as their data grows.

2. **Plain-Language Insights** - Present all statistical findings (correlations, p-values, confidence intervals, R² scores) with plain-language explanations suitable for non-technical users, while providing "Show technical details" toggles for advanced users who want the raw metrics.

3. **Actionable Over Informational** - Every insight, pattern, or correlation must include actionable next steps with clear rationale, expected outcomes, and monitoring plans—never present data without context or guidance on what to do with it.

4. **Trust Through Transparency** - Always show confidence levels, data quality indicators, and sample sizes for analytics; use visual cues (color-coded confidence badges, uncertainty ranges on predictions) to help users understand the reliability of insights.

5. **Context-Aware Search** - Search interface adapts to user intent by auto-detecting search patterns (symptom search vs. date search vs. trigger search) and surfacing relevant filters and facets contextually rather than overwhelming with all options upfront.

6. **Glanceable Dashboard Design** - Analytics dashboard prioritizes information hierarchy with quick-scan cards for high-level insights at the top, progressive depth through click-to-expand sections, and "jump to analysis" shortcuts for deep dives.

7. **Report-Ready by Default** - Every visualization, chart, and analysis result should be designed with sharing in mind—professional styling, clear legends, proper citations of date ranges and data sources—so users can screenshot or export any view for their healthcare team.

8. **Performance Perception Management** - Use skeleton screens during analysis computation, show incremental progress for long operations (report generation, full historical analysis), and display intermediate results as they become available rather than blocking until complete.

9. **Data Story Navigation** - Enable users to navigate their health data as a narrative, not just a database—timelines show causation hints, correlation views link to originating events, search results suggest related patterns, creating an interconnected exploration experience.

10. **Respectful Interruption for Insights** - Proactive notifications for significant discoveries (new high-confidence correlation detected, unusual pattern identified, prediction accuracy improved) use gentle, non-alarming language with clear opt-out controls and adjustable sensitivity thresholds.
