## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

Based on Level 3 classification and Phase 3 scope, the following documents will be generated:

1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - Comprehensive PRD for Phase 3 Intelligence Layer
   - Executive Summary
   - Product Overview and Goals
   - User Personas and Use Cases
   - Feature Requirements (3 epics)
   - Technical Requirements
   - Success Metrics
   - Release Strategy

2. **Epic Stories Document** - Detailed user stories for all 3 epics
   - Epic 1: Data Analysis & Insights (7-9 stories)
   - Epic 2: Advanced Search & Filtering (6-8 stories)
   - Epic 3: Report Generation (5-8 stories)
   - Story format: User story, acceptance criteria, technical notes, dependencies

3. **Architecture Handoff Document** - Technical specifications for implementation
   - Data models and schema updates
   - Component architecture
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Performance considerations
   - Security and privacy requirements

### Workflow Sequence

1. **PRD Creation** (Current workflow)
   - Analyze existing Phase 1 & 2 implementation
   - Define Phase 3 Intelligence Layer requirements
   - Document feature specifications for all 3 epics
   - Define success metrics and KPIs

2. **Epic Story Breakdown**
   - Create detailed user stories for Data Analysis epic
   - Create detailed user stories for Search/Filtering epic
   - Create detailed user stories for Report Generation epic
   - Prioritize stories within each epic
   - Identify dependencies and sequencing

3. **Architecture Review** (Handoff to architect/developer)
   - Technical design for analytics engine
   - Search indexing and query optimization
   - Report generation and export system
   - Integration with existing Phase 1 & 2 components

4. **Implementation Planning**
   - Development sprint planning
   - Task breakdown and estimation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Testing strategy

### Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Proceed to PRD workflow (instructions-lg.md)
   - Load comprehensive PRD template
   - Analyze Phase 3 feature documents (already loaded)
   - Review existing codebase architecture
   - Generate PRD with all required sections

2. **Following:** Epic story generation
   - Break down Phase 3 features into user stories
   - Define acceptance criteria for each story
   - Estimate complexity and dependencies
   - Create epic-stories.md document

3. **Final:** Validation and handoff
   - Review PRD against Phase 3 requirements
   - Validate technical feasibility
   - Create architecture handoff documentation
   - Begin implementation planning

## Special Considerations

### Existing Foundation
- **Phase 1 Complete:** Core MVP with onboarding, symptom tracking, daily entries, calendar, data storage, PWA infrastructure
- **Phase 2 Complete:** HS-specific features including body mapping, photo documentation, active flare dashboard, enhanced trigger tracking, navigation system
- **Strong Architecture:** Well-structured codebase with TypeScript, Next.js 15, React 19, Dexie (IndexedDB), comprehensive repositories and services

### Phase 3 Unique Requirements

**Data Analysis:**
- Must leverage existing data from Phase 1 & 2
- Privacy-first local processing (no cloud analytics)
- Real-time and historical analysis capabilities
- Integration with existing repositories and services

**Search/Filtering:**
- IndexedDB-based search index (no external search engine)
- Fast local search across all data types
- Advanced filtering with facets
- Saved searches and search history

**Report Generation:**
- Professional medical-grade reports
- Multi-format export (PDF, HTML, DOCX, JSON, CSV)
- Chart integration from analysis engine
- Secure sharing with healthcare providers

### Technical Constraints
- **Local-only processing:** All features must work offline
- **Performance:** Sub-second search, real-time analysis
- **Privacy:** No external API calls for sensitive data
- **Storage:** Efficient IndexedDB usage (browser quota limits)
- **Compatibility:** Works with existing Phase 1 & 2 architecture

### Integration Points
- **Data Layer:** Extends existing Dexie repositories
- **Components:** Integrates with daily entry, calendar, dashboard
- **Services:** Builds on export/import services
- **PWA:** Maintains offline-first architecture

## Technical Preferences Captured

### Technology Stack (Existing - Must Align)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5.x
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database:** Dexie 4.2 (IndexedDB wrapper)
- **Charts:** Chart.js 4.5 + react-chartjs-2
- **State:** React Context API + custom hooks
- **PWA:** Custom service worker implementation

### Architecture Patterns (Existing - Must Follow)
- **Repository pattern** for data access
- **Service layer** for business logic
- **Component-based UI** with atomic design
- **Type-safe** with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Offline-first** with progressive enhancement

### Phase 3 Specific Tech Decisions
- **Analytics Engine:** Custom implementation (no external libraries for core analysis)
- **Search Engine:** Local IndexedDB-based search (no Elasticsearch/Algolia)
- **Report Generation:** jsPDF + html2canvas for PDF export
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js for analytics charts
- **Performance:** Web Workers for heavy computations (analysis, indexing)

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled
- **ESLint** with Next.js config
- **Component documentation** with JSDoc
- **Error boundaries** for resilience
- **Performance targets:** <100ms interactions, <3s load times
