# Story 2.5: Senior Developer Review

Reviewer: DEV Agent (AI)
Date: 2025-10-18
Outcome: Approve

## Summary
Story 2.5 (Trigger Analysis Dashboard Integration) adds food-related triggers to the Trigger Analysis dashboard, distinguishes them visually, ranks by correlation strength, supports filtering by type, and enables drill‑down to a detailed correlation view. All acceptance criteria are satisfied. Component‑level tests cover icon rendering, filtering, and navigation.

## Findings
- Food triggers computed from foodEvents and merged with environmental triggers; unified model introduces `type: 'food' | 'environment'` as required.
- UI displays food icon for food‑type entries and includes an accessible filter group (All/Food/Environmental).
- Ranking is applied across merged list by correlationScore.
- Clicking a food row routes to `/foods/[foodId]/correlation?symptom=...` (placeholder view in scope of Story 2.7).
- Accessibility considerations included (aria‑labels, keyboard activation on rows).

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- AC1: Food triggers appear in dashboard alongside existing triggers — Met
- AC2: Food triggers visually distinguished with a food icon — Met
- AC3: Top food triggers ranked by correlation strength — Met (sorted by correlationScore)
- AC4: Clicking a food trigger shows detailed correlation report — Met (routes to detail placeholder)
- AC5: Dashboard supports filtering by trigger type — Met (All/Food/Environmental)

## Tests
- CorrelationMatrix: food icon rendering and onItemClick — PASS
- TriggerCorrelationDashboard: filter behavior and drill‑down navigation (repos mocked; no Dexie) — PASS
- Follow‑up: optional ranking correctness test (nice‑to‑have) can be added to strengthen coverage.

## Notes
- Implemented separator fix in correlation key construction to avoid ID/name split collisions.
- Detail view is intentionally minimal; full report will be delivered under Story 2.7.

## Recommendation
Approve Story 2.5. Proceed to story‑approved workflow and add a small follow‑up test for ranking, if desired.
