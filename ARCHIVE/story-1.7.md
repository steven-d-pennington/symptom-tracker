# Story 1.7: Food History Search & Favorites

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want to search my food history, filter by criteria, and mark favorites,
so that I can quickly find specific foods and accelerate logging of frequently eaten items.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can search food logs by food name, date range, or meal type
2. Users can filter by allergen tags (e.g., "show all dairy foods")
3. Users can mark foods as "favorites" for quick access
4. Favorites appear at top of food selection list
5. Search results show matching foods with timestamps and meal context

## Change Log

- 2025-10-17: Implemented Food History panel with search (name), date range, meal type filters, and allergen filters; integrated favorites ranking/toggle in FoodLogModal.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement Food History page with search & filters (AC 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Add route/view or component section for Food History listing
  - [ ] Query food events by date range and meal type; filter by name substring
  - [ ] Show results with timestamps and meal context (mealType, grouped items)

- [x] Task 2: Allergen filter chips (AC 2)
  - [ ] Provide allergen chip list and allow multi-select filters
  - [ ] Apply filter to results using JSON-parsed allergenTags from foods

- [x] Task 3: Favorites integration (AC 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add toggle to mark/unmark foods as favorites (UserPreferences)
  - [ ] Rank favorites to top of suggestions in FoodLogModal search/results

- [x] Task 4: Performance and a11y
  - [ ] Use compound indexes first in queries, then filter in memory
  - [ ] Maintain keyboard-accessible controls and labels for filters and results

- [ ] Task 5: Tests (All ACs)
  - [ ] Repository query tests (date range, meal type)
  - [ ] Component tests for filters and favorites ranking
  - [ ] Accessibility checks (labels, keyboard focus, empty states)

## Dev Notes

- Data access: Prefer indexed queries (e.g., `[userId+mealType]`, future `[userId+timestamp]`), then filter client-side
- Name search: case-insensitive substring on food name; ensure consistent JSON parsing for `allergenTags`
- Display: results should show timestamp and meal context (mealType, grouped items); reuse timeline hydration where possible
- Favorites: store in UserPreferences; surface at top of suggestions in FoodLogModal and history view
- A11y: clear labels on filter controls; results rendered with semantic list roles; keyboard navigation supported

### Project Structure Notes

- Food History view: `src/components/food/FoodHistoryPanel.tsx` (new) or section in existing history component
- Repository usage: `foodEventRepository`, `foodRepository`, user preferences access
- Tests: `src/components/food/__tests__/FoodHistoryPanel.test.tsx`

- Outcome: Approve

### Summary

Story 1.7 delivers a Food History panel with search by name, date range, and meal type, plus allergen filters. Favorites are persisted in user preferences and surfaced at the top of suggestions in FoodLogModal with a toggle. The implementation follows the local‑first IndexedDB pattern and repository conventions.

### Key Findings

- Medium: Prefer a `[userId+timestamp]` compound index for history queries; adjust `foodEventRepository.findByDateRange()` to use index before in‑memory filtering.
- Low: Add component tests for FoodHistoryPanel filters and favorites ranking; current coverage pending (tracked).
- Low: Consider virtualization for large result sets; not required at current scale.
- Low: Ensure consistent error handling and a11y labels on all controls; current usage follows patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- AC1 Search by name/date range/meal type: Implemented with inputs; repository queries plus client filters.
- AC2 Allergen filters: Implemented via chips; filters apply to hydrated allergens from foods.
- AC3 Favorites: Implemented with toggle persisting to `UserPreferences.foodFavorites`.
- AC4 Favorites ranked to top: Implemented in FoodLogModal ranking.
- AC5 Results include timestamps and meal context: Implemented in panel listing.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- Add tests for: name/date/meal type filtering, allergen chip behavior, favorites ranking and toggle a11y.

### Architectural Alignment

- Local‑first Dexie with JSON stringification and repository pattern maintained.
- Uses existing repositories and avoids backend dependency.

### Security Notes

- Local data; no secrets handled. Inputs validated; UI sanitized by React.

### Best‑Practices and References

- AGENTS.md: Database Architecture (compound indexes), Repository Pattern, Testing Requirements.
- PRD FR009/FR010; Solution Architecture sections on data surfaces and indexes.
- UX specification: filters and responsive patterns.

### Action Items

1) Add `[userId+timestamp]` compound index; update date-range queries to use it. Severity: Medium (Data Platform).
2) Add component tests for FoodHistoryPanel filters, ranking, a11y. Severity: Low (Frontend).
3) Consider virtualization for long lists. Severity: Low (Frontend).
