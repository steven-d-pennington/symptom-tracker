## Overview

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation context for **Story 1.2: Pre-populated Food Database with Allergen Tags**. The context XML provides the DEV agent with everything needed to implement the database foundation for the Food Journal feature.

## Context File Details

**File:** `docs/stories/story-context-1.2.xml`  
**Size:** ~3,800 lines  
**Format:** XML structured implementation guide

### Contents

1. **Metadata**
   - Epic ID: E1
   - Story ID: 1.2
   - Status: Ready
   - Source: docs/stories/story-1.2.md

2. **Story Details**
   - User story breakdown (As a/I want/So that)
   - 10 prioritized tasks with subtasks
   - Estimated effort: 8-12 hours
   - 10 acceptance criteria with verification methods

3. **Technical Artifacts**
   - **Documentation excerpts:**
     - Data models from tech-spec-epic-E1.md (FoodRecord, FoodEventRecord schemas)
     - API contracts for repositories and services
     - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, reliability)
     - Database architecture patterns from AGENTS.md
   
   - **Code patterns to reuse:**
     - Repository pattern from symptomRepository.ts
     - Dexie migration pattern from db/client.ts
     - React Context provider pattern from FoodContext.tsx
     - Component testing patterns from existing tests
   
   - **Dependencies:**
     - dexie 4.2.0 (IndexedDB, liveQuery)
     - uuid 13.0.0 (mealId generation)
     - lucide-react 0.544.0 (icons)
     - Testing: @testing-library/react 16.3.0, jest 30.2.0

4. **Constraints**
   - Performance: <500ms modal save, <250ms search
   - Data: JSON stringification for arrays (local-first convention)
   - Schema: Allergen taxonomy (8 types)
   - Testing: 80% minimum coverage
   - Compatibility: No breaking changes to existing tables

5. **Interfaces**
   - FoodRecord database schema
   - FoodEventRecord database schema
   - foodRepository API (getAll, search, create, update, archive)
   - foodEventRepository API (create, update, delete, findByDateRange, findByMealType)
   - seedFoodsService (200+ foods, batch seeding)
   - AllergenBadge component props
   - FoodContext hooks (useFoods, useFoodEvents, etc.)

6. **Testing Standards**
   - 80% coverage threshold enforced
   - Jest + React Testing Library patterns
   - Repository testing with mock Dexie
   - Component accessibility testing
   - Performance validation (<250ms, <500ms)

7. **Test Ideas**
   - Offline scenario testing
   - Dexie migration upgrade path
   - Soft-delete behavior validation
   - Allergen validation edge cases
   - Batch seeding performance
   - Photo attachment integration

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-context-1.2.xml` (comprehensive context)
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-1.2-context-summary.md` (this file)

### Modified
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-1.2.md` (added context reference)
- ✅ `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md` (updated progress to 60%, marked context complete)

## Implementation Guidance

The context XML provides the DEV agent with:

1. **Clear Task Breakdown**
   - 10 tasks prioritized (critical → low)
   - Each task mapped to acceptance criteria
   - Subtasks providing step-by-step guidance
   - Effort estimates for planning

2. **Reusable Code Patterns**
   - Repository pattern: Follow symptomRepository.ts
   - Dexie migration: Follow version 10 patterns, increment to version 11
   - Context hooks: Extend existing FoodContext with liveQuery
   - Component tests: Follow FoodLogModal.test.tsx patterns

3. **Data Model Specifications**
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces for FoodRecord and FoodEventRecord
   - Compound index definitions for performance
   - JSON stringification conventions for arrays
   - Allergen taxonomy validation rules

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - Specific timing targets (<250ms search, <500ms save)
   - Batch seeding strategy (chunks of 50)
   - Compound index usage patterns
   - Performance testing guidance

5. **Quality Standards**
   - 80% code coverage minimum
   - React Testing Library patterns
   - Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Offline-first validation

## Next Steps

**For DEV Agent Implementation:**

1. **Load DEV Agent**
   ```
   Load: bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md
   ```

2. **Run dev-story Workflow**
   ```
   Command: *dev-story
   ```

3. **Implementation Order** (recommended):
   - Task 1: Dexie schema extension (version 11 migration)
   - Task 2: foodRepository with CRUD operations
   - Task 3: seedFoodsService with 200+ foods
   - Task 4: foodEventRepository for meal logging
   - Task 8: AllergenBadge component
   - Task 5: Wire FoodLogModal to foodRepository
   - Task 6: Implement save handler
   - Task 7: Extend FoodContext with hooks
   - Task 9: Performance validation
   - Task 10: Integration testing

4. **Files to Create** (16 total):
   - `src/lib/db/schema.ts` (extend)
   - `src/lib/db/client.ts` (version 11 migration)
   - `src/lib/repositories/foodRepository.ts` (new)
