# Story 2.3: Combination Effects Detection

Status: Done

Completion Date: 2025-10-18

## Story

As a user,
I want to see if food combinations trigger symptoms more than individual foods,
so that I can identify synergistic dietary triggers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System identifies meals where food combinations correlate with symptoms
2. Compares combination correlation vs. individual food correlations
3. Highlights when combination shows significantly stronger correlation (>15% delta)
4. Minimum 3 instances of combination required for analysis
5. Results display synergy indicator when combination effect exceeds individual foods
6. Combination analysis uses Chi-square test for statistical significance (p < 0.05)

  - [x] Created `FoodCombinationCard.tsx` component with food combination names joined with "+"
  - [x] Added correlation comparison showing combination vs individual max with delta percentage

  - [x] GET accepts same parameters via query params
  - [x] Response structure: `{ correlations: [], combinations: [], metadata: {} }`
  - [x] Added 18 API route tests covering validation, error handling, parameter parsing

- [x] Task 6: Integrate combinations into Trigger Analysis dashboard (AC 2, 3)
  - [x] Created `FoodCombinationsSection` component for displaying combination results
  - [x] Renders `FoodCombinationCard` components for top 5 combinations sorted by synergy strength

  - [x] **Total: 71 tests created, 71 passing (100% pass rate)**

## Dev Notes

- **Combination Detection Logic:** Group food events by `mealId` (meals are multi-food events). Enumerate unique food ID sets (e.g., [dairy, gluten], [dairy, nuts]). For each unique set with >= 3 occurrences, compute correlation with symptoms.
- **Statistical Method:** Use Chi-square test (same as individual correlations per Story 2.1) to calculate p-value. Require p < 0.05 for statistical significance per ADR-008.
- **Synergy Threshold:** Combination considered "synergistic" when: `combinationCorrelation > max(individualCorrelations) + 0.15` (15% delta). Configurable threshold stored in service constant.
- **Sample Size:** Minimum 3 instances required before attempting combination analysis (AC 4). Below threshold, mark as "Insufficient data" similar to dose-response service.
- **Comparison Logic:** For each combination, fetch individual food correlations for all component foods. Use maximum individual correlation as baseline. Display delta percentage in UI.
- **Data Model:** `FoodCombination` table stores combination results separately from `FoodCorrelation`. Both queried together by Trigger Analysis dashboard.
