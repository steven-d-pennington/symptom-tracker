# Pocket Symptom Tracker - Event Stream Redesign PRD

**Author:** Steven
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project Level:** Level 2 (Medium Project)
**Project Type:** Web application (Progressive Web App)
**Target Scale:** 8-10 weeks, 12-15 stories across 3 epics

---

## Description, Context and Goals

### Description

The Event Stream Redesign transforms the Pocket Symptom Tracker from a "daily summary" model to an "event stream" model, fundamentally changing how users interact with the application. Instead of filling out a comprehensive daily form, users will log health events as they happen throughout the day‚Äîmedications at 8am, flare updates at 2pm, triggers at dinner‚Äîcreating a chronological timeline that matches their lived experience of chronic illness.

This redesign addresses the core UX issue discovered through user feedback: the current daily log form is "confusing and overwhelming," causing users to abandon the app mid-entry. The new event-based model enables lightning-fast logging (2-15 seconds depending on event type), progressive disclosure of optional details, and a timeline view that shows "what happened when" rather than forcing reconstruction of the entire day.

**Zero Users = Clean Slate Advantage:** With no active users, we can redesign the database schema from scratch without migration complexity, reducing implementation time from 12 weeks to 8-10 weeks.

### Deployment Intent

This is a **foundational architecture change** deployed as a complete replacement of the current daily log system. The event stream redesign will:

- Replace the daily entry form with quick-log buttons and timeline view
- Introduce new database tables (medicationEvents, triggerEvents, enhanced flares)
- Repurpose the daily log page as an optional end-of-day reflection
- Maintain existing features (analytics, body mapping, photos) by adapting them to consume event stream data

**Rollout Strategy:**
- Clean slate deployment (blow away existing schema, no migration needed)
- All features updated to use event-based data model
- Update DevDataControls to generate realistic test data for new schema
- Comprehensive testing before launch (no real users to impact)

### Context

People living with autoimmune conditions like Hidradenitis Suppurativa experience their symptoms as **discrete timestamped events throughout the day**, not as daily summaries to reconstruct later. A user's reality looks like:

- 8:00am: Take Humira injection
- 2:14pm: Notice new flare in right armpit, severity 7/10
- 4:30pm: Headache started
- 8:43pm: Ate dairy at dinner (known trigger)
- 9:15pm: Flare worsened to 8/10, applied ice

However, the current app forces a **single daily summary form** with 5 sections (Health, Symptoms, Medications, Triggers, Notes), creating:

**Cognitive Dissonance:**
- "Do I average symptoms? Report the worst? List them all?"
- "I already logged at lunch... do I fill this out again?"
- "What's required vs optional?"

**Data Loss:**
- Multiple flare events per day collapsed into one entry
- Temporal context lost (when did it happen relative to meals, meds, stress?)
- Can't track flare progression over hours/days

**User Frustration:**
- Direct feedback: "Dang it! What the heck?" - users abandon mid-entry
- Takes 2-5 minutes when users are in pain and need speed
- Overwhelmed by decision paralysis: 5 sections √ó multiple fields = cognitive overload

The fundamental problem isn't UI polish‚Äîit's a **conceptual model mismatch**. Users need to log events as they happen (event stream), not reconstruct their day later (daily summary). This architectural mismatch causes all downstream confusion and abandonment.

**Why Now:**
- User feedback confirms the daily log is the primary pain point
- With 0 active users, we can redesign the schema without migration risk
- The event stream model is validated by analogous apps (Apple Health, Papaya)
- Quick-log flows reduce logging time from 2-5 minutes to 2-15 seconds

### Goals

1. **Speed - Primary Goal** - Enable users to log health events in 2-15 seconds (depending on event type), down from the current 2-5 minutes for daily entry completion

2. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - Eliminate decision paralysis by providing clear entry points for each event type with progressive disclosure of optional details

3. **Temporal Accuracy** - Capture when events happened throughout the day with automatic timestamps, preserving cause-and-effect relationships between triggers, medications, and symptoms

4. **Flare Lifecycle Tracking** - Enable users to create, update, and resolve active flares over hours/days, tracking severity progression and interventions

5. **Match Mental Model** - Align the app's data model with how users actually experience chronic illness (discrete events) rather than forcing daily summaries

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

## UX Design Principles

1. **Event Stream Over Daily Summary** - Design every interaction around logging discrete timestamped events as they happen, never force users to reconstruct their entire day in one sitting.

2. **Speed as Primary Metric** - Every quick-log flow must be optimized for minimum time to completion (2-15 seconds), measured and validated with real users in pain experiencing cognitive load.

3. **Progressive Disclosure by Default** - Start with bare minimum required fields (medication checkbox, symptom name, flare location + severity), reveal optional fields ("Add Details" button) only when user has time and energy.

4. **Flares ‚â† Symptoms** - Treat HS flares as ongoing states requiring lifecycle management (create ‚Üí update ‚Üí resolve) with prominent active flare display, not as discrete symptom events.

5. **Timeline as Primary View** - Replace the daily entry form with a chronological event feed showing "what happened when" with automatic timestamps, making cause-and-effect relationships visible.

6. **One-Tap Whenever Possible** - Optimize for common cases (checking medication, logging recent symptom, marking trigger) to complete with single tap, expanding to details only when needed.

7. **Visual Indicators for State** - Use trend arrows (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí) for flare progression, color coding for severity, and duration badges for active flares to enable at-a-glance status understanding.

8. **Smart Defaults and Suggestions** - Show recent/favorite symptoms first, suggest medication notes from history, remember user patterns to reduce repeated decision-making.

9. **Offline-First Always** - Treat offline capability as non-negotiable; every quick-log action must work without network, storing locally and syncing transparently when online.

10. **Clear Entry Points** - Provide obvious, emoji-labeled buttons for each event type (üî•üíäüò£‚ö†Ô∏è) on home screen, eliminating "what do I do?" confusion.

## Epics

### Epic 1: Database Schema & Repositories

- Home screen loads <1 second
- End-to-end tests passing

**Story Count:** 3-5 stories

---

**Total Estimated Stories: 12-17 stories across 3 epics**

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Epic 1** (Foundation) - Build database and repositories first
2. **Epic 2** (Quick-Log) - Build UI components with test data
3. **Epic 3** (Integration) - Connect features and deploy

## Out of Scope

**Advanced Event Features (Future):**
- Voice-activated quick-logging via Siri/Google Assistant
- Wearable device integration (Apple Watch complications for quick-log)
- AI-powered event suggestions ("You usually take meds now, log it?")
- Automatic event detection via device sensors
- Multi-day timeline view with week/month aggregation

**Flare Enhancements (Phase 4+):**
- Flare photo comparison slider (before/during/after)
- Flare severity heatmaps over time
- Predictive flare warnings based on patterns
- Flare treatment effectiveness scoring
- Doctor-shareable flare progression reports

**Social Features (Not Planned):**
- Shared timelines with caregivers
- Community event patterns ("Others with HS often see...")
- Support group check-ins
- Medication reminder notifications to family

**Migration Complexity (Eliminated by 0 Users):**
- Backward compatibility with old schema
- Data migration scripts from dailyEntries
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Legacy code path maintenance

**Rationale:** These features either introduce significant scope creep, require external integrations beyond current architecture, or were eliminated by the zero-user advantage. Focus is on core event stream model with fast logging and timeline view.

---

## Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions:**

1. **Zero Active Users** - No real users exist, allowing clean slate schema redesign without migration scripts, data loss concerns, or gradual rollout complexity.

2. **User Logging Behavior** - Users will adopt quick-log buttons over comprehensive daily forms if speed difference is significant (2-15 sec vs 2-5 min).

3. **Flare Onset Timing** - Users have 10-15 seconds to log new flares (flares have gradual onset with warning signs, not sudden emergencies).

4. **Progressive Disclosure Acceptance** - Users will be comfortable logging minimal data upfront (name, time) and adding details later when they have energy.

5. **Mobile-First Usage** - Primary interaction will be on mobile devices in real-world contexts (work, home, on-the-go), requiring one-handed operation.

6. **Timeline Pagination** - Showing today only (1 day) with "Load more" will be sufficient; users don't need week/month views in primary timeline.

**Dependencies:**

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Existing codebase: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Dexie, Tailwind CSS
- Dexie.js IndexedDB wrapper for local storage
- Body mapping system from Phase 2 (reuse for flare location)
- Photo system from Phase 2 (integrate with event detail modal)
- Existing repositories (symptoms, medications, triggers definitions)

**Data Dependencies:**
- Medications table with user's current medication list
- Symptoms table with predefined + custom symptom definitions
- Triggers table with common trigger options
- Body regions table for anatomical location mapping

**Feature Dependencies:**
- DevDataControls must be updated BEFORE component development (need test data)
- Database schema must be complete BEFORE any UI work (data layer first)
- Timeline aggregation service needed for chronological event feed
- Flare state management separate from general symptom instances

**Integration Dependencies:**
- Analytics service must consume event stream data (not dailyEntries)
- Export service must serialize all event types (medications, triggers, symptoms, flares)
- Photo attachment system must link to eventId (not just dailyEntryId)
