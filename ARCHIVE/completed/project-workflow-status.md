## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** web (Web Application)
- **Project Level:** 2
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-med.md (Level 2 - Medium project with multiple epics)
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** brownfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Medium-sized web application project (Level 2)
- **Estimated Stories:** 5-15 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2 epics
- **Timeline:** To be determined during planning

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** Yes - Good documentation exists
- **Team Size:** Individual developer
- **Deployment Intent:** To be determined

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 2 (Planning):**
- PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Epics breakdown
- Story backlog (5-15 stories)
- UX Specification (user flows, wireframes, component specs)

**Phase 4 (Implementation):**
- Story files (drafted and implemented)
- Context XML files per story
- Working code delivered

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Phase 2 - Planning**
   - Run `plan-project` (PM agent) ‚Üí Generate PRD with epics and stories
   - Run `ux-spec` (PM agent) ‚Üí Create UX/UI specification

2. **Phase 4 - Implementation** (Iterative)
   - Run `create-story` (SM agent) ‚Üí Draft next story
   - Run `story-ready` (SM agent) ‚Üí Approve story for development
   - Run `story-context` (SM agent) ‚Üí Generate context XML
   - Run `dev-story` (DEV agent) ‚Üí Implement story
   - Run `story-approved` (DEV agent) ‚Üí Mark story complete
   - Repeat until all stories complete

### Next Actions

**Immediate Next Step:**
1. Load DEV agent
2. Run `dev-story` workflow for Story 2.1 (QuickLog Buttons)
3. Implement component using docs/stories/story-context-2.1.xml as guidance

## Special Considerations

- **UI Components:** Project has user-facing UI - UX workflow included
- **Documentation:** Brownfield project with good existing documentation - can leverage for planning
- **Level 2 Scope:** Focus on 1-2 coherent epics, keep story count between 5-15
- **No Phase 3:** Level 2 projects skip solutioning phase - go directly from planning to implementation

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Web application (likely React/Next.js based on existing codebase structure)
- TypeScript codebase
- Database: Likely SQL-based (to be confirmed in PRD)

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 2 (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `C:\projects\symptom-tracker\docs\stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in epics.md (5-15 total for Level 2)
