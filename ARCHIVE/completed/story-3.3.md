# Story 3.3: Update Exports and Trigger Correlation

Status: Ready for Review

## Story (Export)

As a user exporting data,
I want to export all event types in CSV and JSON,
so that I can share comprehensive data with my doctor or analyze externally.

## Story (Correlation)

As a user analyzing triggers,
I want to see correlations based on trigger events and symptom events,
so that I can identify cause-and-effect relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria - Export

1. CSV export includes all event types: one row per event with columns: type, timestamp, name, details
2. JSON export structured by event type: `{ medicationEvents: [...], triggerEvents: [...], ... }`
3. Export includes flare progression: severity history and interventions
4. Export preserves timestamps in ISO 8601 format for external tools
5. File size reasonable for 1 year of data (<5MB for typical user)

## Acceptance Criteria - Trigger Correlation

1. Correlation dashboard queries triggerEvents table for exposures
2. Queries symptomInstances and flares for symptom data
3. Correlation calculation uses timestamps for temporal analysis (trigger at T, symptom at T+2h)
4. Displays correlation matrix: triggers vs symptoms with correlation coefficients
5. Time-lag analysis: shows most common delay between trigger and symptom

## Dev Notes

**Technical Approach:**
- Update exportService to query event tables instead of dailyEntries
- CSV format: simple row-per-event structure
- JSON format: structured by event type for programmatic access
- Temporal correlation: bucket analysis for time-lag detection

**CSV Export Format:**
```csv
type,timestamp,name,details
medication,2025-10-13T08:00:00.000Z,Humira,taken
trigger,2025-10-13T12:30:00.000Z,Dairy,medium
symptom,2025-10-13T14:45:00.000Z,Headache,severity:6
flare,2025-10-13T15:00:00.000Z,Right armpit,severity:7
```

**JSON Export Format:**
```json
{
  "medicationEvents": [...],
  "triggerEvents": [...],
  "symptomInstances": [...],
  "flares": [...]
}
```

**Correlation Calculation:**
- For each trigger: count trigger events
- For each symptom: count symptom instances within time window after trigger
- Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
- Time-lag: most common bucket with highest correlation

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Update:**
- `src/lib/services/exportService.ts`
- `src/components/triggers/TriggerCorrelationDashboard.tsx`

**Dependencies:**
- All event repositories (medication, trigger, symptom, flare)
- Correlation calculation library or custom implementation

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-15: Implementation Plan
  - Refactor exportService to query event repositories (medicationEventRepository, triggerEventRepository, symptomInstanceRepository, flareRepository)
  - Update collectData() to fetch events in date range using repository findByDateRange() methods
  - Implement new CSV format: header `type,timestamp,name,details` with one row per event
  - Implement new JSON format: structure with top-level keys medicationEvents, triggerEvents, symptomInstances, flares
  - Update TriggerCorrelationDashboard to query event repositories instead of dailyEntries
  - Implement temporal correlation utility with time-bucket windows (0-2h, 2-4h, 4-6h, 6-12h, 12-24h)
  - Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients and identify most common time-lag
  - Update CorrelationMatrix to display results with color-coded coefficients

### Completion Notes List

- 2025-10-15: Implementation Complete
  - **Export Service Refactor:** Updated exportService.ts to query event repositories instead of dailyEntries. Added new ExportData structure with medicationEvents, triggerEvents, symptomInstances, and flares arrays. CSV export now uses one-row-per-event format with header `type,timestamp,name,details`. JSON export structured by event type with full data preservation. All timestamps use ISO 8601 format.
  - **Temporal Correlation Analysis:** Created correlation.ts utility with calculateTemporalCorrelation() function using time-bucket windows (0-2h, 2-4h, 4-6h, 6-12h, 12-24h). Analyzes symptoms that occur after triggers within 24-hour windows. Calculates correlation scores based on occurrence frequency and bucket concentration.
  - **Dashboard Updates:** Refactored TriggerCorrelationDashboard to use triggerEventRepository and symptomInstanceRepository instead of dailyEntries. Queries last 90 days of data using compound indexes for performance. Resolves trigger names from trigger definitions.
  - **Visualization Enhancements:** Updated CorrelationMatrix to display time-lag information alongside correlation scores, occurrences, and average severity. Shows most common time delay bucket for each trigger-symptom pair.
  - **Type Extensions:** Added optional `timeLag` field to TriggerCorrelation interface to support time-lag analysis display.
