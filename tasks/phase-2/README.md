# Phase 2 Task Tracking - HS-Specific Features

## Overview

This document serves as the central hub for tracking all Phase 2 development tasks for the Pocket Symptom Tracker PWA. Phase 2 focuses on building specialized features specifically for Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) and other autoimmune conditions, including visual body mapping, photo documentation, active flare monitoring, and enhanced trigger tracking.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 tasks documented and ready for development. Phase 1 completed successfully.

## Phase 2 Scope

**Target Completion**: March 2026
**Total Tasks**: 4 major components
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete (all 6 tasks âœ…)

### Phase 2 Components
1. **Body Mapping System** - Visual anatomical symptom location tracking
2. **Photo Documentation** - Secure medical photo storage and organization
3. **Active Flare Dashboard** - Real-time symptom monitoring and emergency management
4. **Enhanced Trigger Tracking** - Advanced correlation analysis and pattern detection

## Task Tracking Instructions

### For Developers/Agents

1. **Check Task Status**: Review this master document to see available tasks
2. **Claim a Task**: Update the "Assigned To" field in the task document
3. **Update Status**: Change status from "Not Started" â†’ "Started" â†’ "Complete"
4. **Document Progress**: Add detailed notes in the task document about:
   - What was implemented
   - Challenges encountered
   - Decisions made
   - Testing completed
   - Files created/modified
5. **Blockers**: If blocked, clearly document the blocker and @mention for help
6. **Code Reviews**: Mark as "Ready for Review" when implementation is complete

### Status Definitions
- **Not Started**: Task is ready to be claimed
- **Started**: Someone is actively working on it

**Total Estimated Hours**: 104 hours

## Development Workflow

### Daily Standup Process
1. Review current task status
2. Update progress notes in task document
3. Identify and document any blockers
4. Plan next steps for the day
5. Update time spent and total hours

### Code Review Process
1. Mark task as "Ready for Review" when complete
2. Create PR with detailed description
3. Reference task document in PR
4. Address review feedback
5. Mark as "Complete" after approval and merge

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new utilities and functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for feature workflows
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Cross-browser compatibility checks
- Mobile device testing

## Phase 2 Architecture

### Technology Stack (from Phase 1)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Database**: Dexie.js (IndexedDB) for local storage
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **PWA**: Service Worker with offline support
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### New Phase 2 Technologies
- **SVG Rendering**: For body mapping visuals
- **Image Processing**: For photo compression and encryption
- **Canvas API**: For photo annotation
- **File API**: For photo upload and storage
- **Crypto API**: For photo encryption

### Architecture Principles
- **Privacy-First**: All photos stored locally with encryption
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without network
- **Performance**: Optimize for large image datasets
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work everywhere

## Integration with Phase 1

### Data Model Extensions
Phase 2 builds on Phase 1's data architecture:
- **DailyEntry** extended with `bodyMapLocations[]` and `photoIds[]`
- **Symptom** extended with `typicalBodyRegions[]`
- **Trigger** extended with `correlatedBodyRegions[]`
- New **BodyMapLocation** and **PhotoAttachment** entities

### Component Integration
- Body mapping integrates with daily entry system (Task 3)
- Photos link to daily entries and symptoms (Task 2)
- Active flare dashboard uses calendar data (Task 4)
- Trigger tracking builds on existing trigger repository (Task 5)

### Service Integration
- Photo service uses export/import service (Task 5)
- Backup service includes encrypted photo data
- Sync service handles photo metadata (not photo files)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Body mapping allows precise symptom location tracking
- [ ] Photos are encrypted and stored securely locally
- [ ] Active flare dashboard provides real-time monitoring
- [ ] Enhanced trigger tracking identifies correlations
- [ ] All features integrate seamlessly with Phase 1
- [ ] Performance targets met with image datasets

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Security review for photo encryption
- [ ] Cross-browser/device compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks with large photo libraries
- [ ] Privacy audit for photo handling

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Body mapping is intuitive on touch devices
- [ ] Photo capture workflow is simple (< 30 seconds)
- [ ] Flare dashboard provides actionable insights
- [ ] Trigger correlations are easy to understand
- [ ] Help documentation for all new features

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Storage Quotas**: Large photo datasets may exceed browser limits
- **Encryption Performance**: Photo encryption may slow down app
- **SVG Complexity**: Body maps may be performance intensive
- **Browser API Differences**: Camera/file APIs vary across browsers

### User Experience Risks
- **Photo Privacy**: Users may be uncomfortable with photo storage
- **Body Mapping Accuracy**: Users may struggle with precise placement
- **Overwhelming Data**: Too much information on flare dashboard
- **Mobile Performance**: Complex features may lag on older devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Smart Storage**: Compress photos, warn about quotas, offer cleanup tools
- **Background Encryption**: Encrypt photos asynchronously, show progress
- **Simplified Body Maps**: Start with basic regions, add detail progressively
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential data first, advanced features on demand
- **Performance Budget**: Set and monitor performance metrics, optimize proactively

## Phase 2 Roadmap

### Month 1: Body Mapping (Task 7)
