# Phase 1 Task Tracking - Master Document

## Overview

This document serves as the central hub for tracking all Phase 1 development tasks for the Pocket Symptom Tracker PWA. Phase 1 focuses on building the core MVP with essential features for symptom tracking and data management.

**Current Status**: All Phase 1 task documents have been created and are ready for development. Tasks 1-4 can be developed in parallel, while Tasks 5-6 depend on the completion of Tasks 1-4.

## Phase 1 Scope

**Target Completion**: December 2025
**Total Tasks**: 6 major components
**Parallel Work**: Tasks 1-4 can be developed simultaneously, Tasks 5-6 depend on Tasks 1-4

### Phase 1 Components
1. **Onboarding System** - Multi-step user setup and education
2. **Symptom Tracking** - Flexible symptom recording and management
3. **Daily Entry System** - Central logging mechanism with smart defaults
4. **Calendar/Timeline Views** - Historical data navigation and visualization
5. **Data Storage Architecture** - IndexedDB implementation and data management
6. **PWA Infrastructure** - Service workers, caching, and offline functionality

## Task Tracking Instructions

### For Developers/Agents

1. **Check Task Status**: Review this master document to see available tasks
2. **Claim a Task**: Update the "Assigned To" field in the task document
3. **Update Status**: Change status from "Not Started" → "Started" → "Complete"
4. **Document Progress**: Add detailed notes in the task document about:
   - What was implemented
   - Challenges encountered
   - Decisions made
   - Testing completed
   - Files created/modified
5. **Blockers**: If blocked, clearly document the blocker and @mention for help
6. **Code Reviews**: Mark as "Ready for Review" when implementation is complete

### Status Definitions
- **Not Started**: Task is ready to be claimed
- **Started**: Someone is actively working on it
- **Blocked**: Work stopped due to dependencies or issues
- **Complete**: Implementation finished and tested
- **Ready for Review**: Code complete, needs review before marking complete

### Communication Protocol
- Use @mentions for blockers: `@steven-d-pennington BLOCKED: [description]`
- Update status immediately when starting/stopping work
- Document all decisions and rationale in task notes
- Include file paths and component names in progress updates

## Task Status Overview

### Parallel Tasks (Can work simultaneously)
| Task | Status | Assigned To | Priority | Est. Hours |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| [Task 1: Onboarding System](./tasks/01-onboarding-system.md) | Documents Complete | Unassigned | High | 16 |
| [Task 2: Symptom Tracking](./tasks/02-symptom-tracking.md) | Documents Complete | Unassigned | High | 20 |
| [Task 3: Daily Entry System](./tasks/03-daily-entry-system.md) | Documents Complete | Unassigned | High | 24 |
| [Task 4: Calendar/Timeline](./tasks/04-calendar-timeline.md) | Documents Complete | Unassigned | High | 28 |

### Sequential Tasks (Depend on Parallel Tasks)
| Task | Status | Assigned To | Priority | Est. Hours | Dependencies |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|------------|--------------|
| [Task 5: Data Storage](./tasks/05-data-storage.md) | Documents Complete | Unassigned | Critical | 32 | Tasks 1-4 |
| [Task 6: PWA Infrastructure](./tasks/06-pwa-infrastructure.md) | Documents Complete | Unassigned | Critical | 20 | Tasks 1-4 |

## Development Workflow

### Daily Standup Process
1. **Morning**: Check master document for updates
2. **Update Status**: Mark any completed work, note blockers
3. **Claim Tasks**: Assign yourself to available tasks
4. **Coordinate**: Discuss parallel work and dependencies

### Code Standards
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Implement accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Write unit tests for all utilities and components
- Include error boundaries and proper error handling
- Document components with JSDoc comments
- Follow the established file structure

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for data flows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Performance testing with Lighthouse

## Quality Gates

### Before Marking Complete
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80% for new code
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (Lighthouse >90)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms interactions)
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Components work together without conflicts
- [ ] Data flows correctly between features
- [ ] Offline functionality verified
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness confirmed

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Blockers
- **IndexedDB Issues**: Test across different browsers
- **Service Worker Conflicts**: Implement proper versioning
- **State Management**: Use consistent patterns across components
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor bundle size and runtime performance

### Escalation Process
1. Document blocker in task document
2. @mention project lead if blocked >24 hours
3. Schedule pair programming session if needed
4. Consider alternative approaches if blocked >48 hours

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Project setup, basic component structure
- **Week 2**: Core functionality implementation
- **Week 3**: Integration and testing
- **Week 4**: Polish, optimization, and final testing

### Success Metrics
- All tasks completed by target date
- Zero critical bugs in production
- User acceptance testing passed
- Performance targets achieved
- Accessibility compliance verified
