## Task Overview

**Status**: Not Started
**Assigned To**: Unassigned
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Hours**: 20
**Dependencies**: None
**Parallel Work**: Can be worked on simultaneously with Tasks 1, 3-4

## Objective

Implement a flexible symptom tracking system that allows users to record, categorize, and manage various symptoms with customizable severity scales, categories, and metadata.

## Detailed Requirements

### User Experience Goals
- **Flexible Categorization**: Support various symptom types and categories
- **Intuitive Severity**: Easy-to-use severity scales with visual indicators
- **Rich Metadata**: Location, duration, triggers, and notes
- **Quick Entry**: Fast logging for frequent symptoms
- **Historical View**: Easy access to past symptom records

### Technical Requirements
- **Customizable Categories**: User-defined symptom categories
- **Severity Scales**: Multiple scale types (1-10, mild-moderate-severe, etc.)
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity and consistency
- **Search/Filter**: Find symptoms by various criteria
- **Export Ready**: Prepare data for reports and analysis

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data Model and Types
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

1. Define TypeScript interfaces for symptom tracking:
   ```typescript
   interface Symptom {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     name: string;
     category: string;
     severity: number;
     severityScale: SeverityScale;
     location?: string;
     duration?: number; // minutes
     triggers?: string[];
     notes?: string;
     photos?: string[]; // photo IDs
     timestamp: Date;
     updatedAt: Date;
   }

   interface SymptomCategory {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     name: string;
     description?: string;
     color: string;
     icon?: string;
     isDefault: boolean;
     createdAt: Date;
   }

   interface SeverityScale {
     type: 'numeric' | 'descriptive' | 'custom';
     min: number;
     max: number;
     labels?: Record<number, string>;
     colors?: Record<number, string>;
   }
   ```

2. Create symptom-related database schemas (for future integration)

3. Set up component directory structure:
   ```
   components/symptoms/
   ├── SymptomTracker.tsx          # Main symptom tracking interface
   ├── SymptomForm.tsx             # Add/edit symptom form
   ├── SymptomList.tsx             # Symptom history list
   ├── SymptomCard.tsx             # Individual symptom display
   ├── SymptomFilters.tsx          # Filter and search controls
   ├── SeverityScale.tsx           # Severity input component
   ├── SymptomCategories.tsx       # Category management
   └── hooks/
       ├── useSymptoms.ts          # Symptom data management
       └── useSymptomCategories.ts # Category management
   ```

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/types/symptoms.ts`
- `components/symptoms/SymptomTracker.tsx`
- `components/symptoms/hooks/useSymptoms.ts`

**Testing**: Type definitions compile, basic hook structure works

---

### Step 2: Symptom Form Component
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

1. Implement `SymptomForm.tsx`:
   - Symptom name input with autocomplete
   - Category selection dropdown
   - Severity scale selector
   - Location picker (body mapping integration point)
   - Duration input
   - Trigger selection
   - Notes textarea
   - Photo attachment (future integration)

2. Form validation and error handling

3. Smart defaults based on user history

**Files to Modify**:
- `components/symptoms/SymptomForm.tsx`
- `components/symptoms/SeverityScale.tsx`

**Testing**: Form renders, validation works, data submission functions

---

### Step 3: Symptom List and Cards
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

1. Implement `SymptomCard.tsx`:
   - Symptom name and category
   - Severity visualization
   - Timestamp and duration
   - Quick actions (edit, delete)
   - Expandable details

2. Implement `SymptomList.tsx`:
   - Sortable list of symptom cards
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Empty state handling
   - Loading states

3. Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Files to Modify**:
- `components/symptoms/SymptomCard.tsx`
- `components/symptoms/SymptomList.tsx`

**Testing**: Cards display correctly, list pagination works, accessibility features

---

### Step 4: Category Management
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

1. Implement `SymptomCategories.tsx`:
   - View existing categories
   - Add new categories
   - Edit category properties (color, icon)
   - Delete categories (with data migration)

2. Default categories for common conditions

3. Category-based filtering

**Files to Modify**:
- `components/symptoms/SymptomCategories.tsx`
- `components/symptoms/hooks/useSymptomCategories.ts`

**Testing**: Category CRUD operations work, filtering functions correctly

---

### Step 5: Filtering and Search
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

1. Implement `SymptomFilters.tsx`:
   - Text search across symptom names and notes
   - Category filtering
   - Severity range filtering
   - Date range filtering
   - Location filtering

2. Saved filter presets

3. Filter state management

**Files to Modify**:
