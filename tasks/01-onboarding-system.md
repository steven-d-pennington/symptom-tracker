## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup and File Structure
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

1. Create onboarding component directory structure:
   ```
   app/onboarding/
   ├── page.tsx                    # Main onboarding page
   ├── components/
   │   ├── OnboardingFlow.tsx      # Main flow controller
   │   ├── ProgressIndicator.tsx   # Step progress UI
   │   ├── WelcomeStep.tsx         # Initial welcome screen
   │   ├── ConditionStep.tsx       # Condition selection
   │   ├── PreferencesStep.tsx     # Tracking preferences
   │   ├── EducationStep.tsx       # Educational content
   │   ├── PrivacyStep.tsx         # Privacy and data explanation
   │   └── CompletionStep.tsx      # Setup complete
   ├── hooks/
   │   └── useOnboarding.ts        # Onboarding state management
   ├── types/
   │   └── onboarding.ts           # TypeScript interfaces
   └── utils/
       └── onboardingConfig.ts     # Configuration data
   ```

2. Set up basic TypeScript interfaces:
   ```typescript
   interface OnboardingState {
     currentStep: number;
     completedSteps: number[];
     userData: OnboardingData;
     isComplete: boolean;
   }

   interface OnboardingData {
     condition: string;
     experience: 'new' | 'experienced' | 'returning';
     trackingPreferences: TrackingPreferences;
     privacySettings: PrivacySettings;
     educationalContent: EducationalProgress;
   }
   ```

3. Create basic component files with placeholder content

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/components/OnboardingFlow.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/types/onboarding.ts`

**Testing**: Verify component imports and basic rendering

**Testing**: Component renders correctly, navigation works, accessibility passes

---

### Step 3: Condition Selection Step
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

1. Implement `ConditionStep.tsx`:
   - Autoimmune condition selection (HS, RA, Lupus, etc.)
   - "Other" option with custom input
   - Educational tooltips explaining conditions
   - Skip option for general symptom tracking

2. Add condition-specific guidance and resource links

3. Update onboarding state management

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/onboarding/components/ConditionStep.tsx`

**Testing**: All condition options work, state updates correctly, validation functions

---

### Step 4: Tracking Preferences Step
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

1. Implement `PreferencesStep.tsx`:
   - Symptom categories to track
   - Tracking frequency preferences
   - Data sharing preferences (local only)
   - Notification preferences

2. Smart defaults based on selected condition

3. Form validation and error handling

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/onboarding/components/PreferencesStep.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/utils/onboardingConfig.ts`
