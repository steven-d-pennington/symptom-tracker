## üéØ What Makes This Special

**100% Local-First**: Every piece of your health data stays on your device. No cloud. No servers. No data mining.

**Precision Body Mapping**: Enhanced interactive body map with groin-specific regions, zoom/pan functionality, and coordinate-level precision for exact flare location tracking‚Äîtransforming basic symptom logging into medical-grade anatomical documentation.

**Complete Flare Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor individual flares from onset through resolution with persistent entities, severity progression, trend analysis (improving/worsening/stable), and intervention logging for comprehensive treatment effectiveness evaluation.

**Comprehensive Health Tracking**: Log symptoms, medications, triggers, food intake, photos, and precise body locations‚Äîall in one integrated system with correlation analysis.

**Smart Insights**: Automated correlation analysis with statistical significance testing helps you discover patterns between what you eat, what you're exposed to, and how you feel‚Äîincluding time-delayed effects, dose-response patterns, and food combination triggers.

**Medical-Grade Privacy**: AES-256-GCM encryption for photos, EXIF stripping, zero external data transmission, and optional on-device UX instrumentation.

**Truly Offline**: Full functionality without internet connection. Install as an app on any device.
