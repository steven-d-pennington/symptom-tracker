# Build Plan

## Cloud-First Architecture

Our architecture will adopt a cloud-first approach, ensuring that all services and data are primarily managed in the cloud. This will allow for:
- Enhanced scalability to accommodate varying loads
- Simplified management and maintenance of resources
- Improved collaboration through centralized data access

## Offline Capabilities

While the cloud-first approach is prioritized, offline capabilities will be integrated as a default feature. This will ensure that:
- Users can access essential functionalities without an internet connection
- Data synchronization occurs seamlessly when connectivity is restored

## Emphasizing Privacy

We will prioritize user privacy by implementing:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Minimal data collection practices
- User control over data sharing settings

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture will be designed to scale efficiently, incorporating:
- Load balancing mechanisms
- Auto-scaling features for resource allocation
- Modular service design to facilitate independent scaling of components

By adopting this architecture, we aim to provide a robust, user-friendly experience that aligns with modern expectations for privacy and performance.
