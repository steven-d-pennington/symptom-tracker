# Build Plan

## Local-First Architecture

We are adopting a local-first architecture, emphasizing local storage as the default approach. This ensures that users have access to their data without being dependent on network connectivity. 

### Key Priorities:

- **Privacy**: User data will be stored locally, minimizing exposure to external servers.
- **Offline Capabilities**: The application will function fully offline, providing uninterrupted access to data.

## Roadmap

While cloud sync and advanced analytics are recognized as valuable features, they are currently out of scope. Future plans include:

- **Cloud Sync**: To enable data synchronization across devices while maintaining user control over their data.
- **Advanced Analytics**: To provide insights and improvements based on user interactions and data patterns.
