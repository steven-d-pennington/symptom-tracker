# Task 10: Enhanced Trigger Tracking Implementation

## Task Overview

**Status**: Not Started
**Assigned To**: Unassigned
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Hours**: 20
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete
**Parallel Work**: Can be worked on simultaneously with Tasks 7-9

## Objective

Enhance the existing trigger tracking system with advanced correlation analysis, pattern detection, and predictive insights. Build upon Phase 1's basic trigger repository to help users identify what factors influence their symptoms and make informed decisions about lifestyle and environmental modifications.

## Detailed Requirements

### User Experience Goals
- **Easy Discovery**: Simple interface to identify potential triggers
- **Visual Correlations**: Clear charts showing trigger-symptom relationships
- **Actionable Insights**: Specific recommendations for trigger avoidance
- **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical confidence in correlations
- **Trigger Categories**: Organized by food, environment, stress, activity, etc.
- **Prediction**: Early warning when high-risk triggers present

### Technical Requirements
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation coefficients and significance testing
- **Pattern Detection**: Machine learning-lite pattern recognition
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-lag correlation (trigger â†’ symptom delay)
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combined trigger effects
- **Performance**: Fast calculations even with years of data

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enhanced Trigger Data Model
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

1. Extend trigger types:
   ```typescript
   interface EnhancedTrigger extends TriggerRecord {
     category: TriggerCategory;
     subcategory?: string;
     severity?: number; // Some triggers are more potent
     typicalDelay?: number; // Hours until symptom appears
     confidence?: number; // User's confidence this is a trigger
   }

   type TriggerCategory =
     | 'food'
     | 'environmental'
     | 'stress'
     | 'activity'
     | 'sleep'
     | 'medication'
     | 'weather'
     | 'hormonal'
     | 'other';

   interface TriggerExposure {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     triggerId: string;
     dailyEntryId?: string;
     exposureLevel: number; // 1-10 intensity
     timestamp: Date;
     notes?: string;
   }

   interface TriggerCorrelation {
     id: string;
     userId: string;
     triggerId: string;
     symptomId: string;
     correlationCoefficient: number; // -1 to 1
     significance: number; // p-value
     dataPoints: number;
     averageDelay: number; // hours
     confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'very_high';
     lastCalculated: Date;
   }
   ```

2. Create trigger analytics tables:
   ```typescript
   this.version(5).stores({
     triggerExposures: 'id, userId, triggerId, dailyEntryId, timestamp',
     triggerCorrelations: 'id, userId, triggerId, symptomId, [userId+triggerId], [userId+symptomId]',
   });
   ```

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/types/enhanced-trigger.ts`
- `lib/repositories/triggerExposureRepository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/triggerCorrelationRepository.ts`

**Testing**: Schema updates, repositories functional

### Step 2: Correlation Analysis Engine
**Estimated Time**: 5 hours

1. Implement statistical analysis:
   ```typescript
   class TriggerAnalyzer {
     // Calculate Pearson correlation between trigger exposure and symptom severity
     async calculateCorrelation(
       userId: string,
       triggerId: string,
       symptomId: string,
       days: number
     ): Promise<TriggerCorrelation>;

     // Find time lag between trigger and symptom
     async findOptimalDelay(
       userId: string,
       triggerId: string,
       symptomId: string
     ): Promise<number>;

     // Calculate statistical significance
     async calculateSignificance(
       correlation: number,
       sampleSize: number
     ): Promise<number>;

     // Identify most impactful triggers
     async getRankedTriggers(
       userId: string,
       symptomId?: string
     ): Promise<TriggerCorrelation[]>;
   }
   ```

2. Add pattern detection:
   - Identify trigger combinations
   - Detect threshold effects (small amounts OK, large amounts bad)
   - Find seasonal patterns
   - Recognize cumulative effects

3. Implement confidence scoring:
   - High confidence: p < 0.01, n > 30
   - Medium confidence: p < 0.05, n > 15
   - Low confidence: p < 0.1, n > 10
   - Insufficient data: below thresholds

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/utils/triggerAnalyzer.ts`
- `lib/utils/statisticalTests.ts`

**Testing**: Calculations accurate, patterns detected, confidence scores appropriate
