## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in build system with optimizations
- **Database**: Dexie.js wrapper over IndexedDB for local storage
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **PWA**: Next.js PWA plugin with service workers

### Architecture Principles
- **Offline-First**: All features work without network connectivity
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works in all modern browsers
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second load times, smooth 60fps interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support
- **Privacy**: Zero external data sharing without explicit user consent

### Development Standards
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with reusable, composable components
- **State Management**: Predictable, immutable updates with proper error boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- **Testing**: Unit tests for utilities, integration tests for components, E2E for critical flows
- **Documentation**: Inline JSDoc comments, component documentation, and implementation guides

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All core features implemented and thoroughly tested
- [ ] PWA installable on desktop and mobile with offline functionality
- [ ] Data persists across browser sessions and device restarts
- [ ] All user stories satisfied with intuitive workflows
- [ ] Performance targets met ( Lighthouse scores >90)

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Security review completed with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness confirmed on all screen sizes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved with <100ms interaction latency

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive onboarding flow with <5% drop-off rate
- [ ] Consistent interaction patterns following platform conventions
- [ ] Clear error handling with actionable recovery suggestions
- [ ] Efficient data entry workflows with keyboard shortcuts and smart defaults
- [ ] Comprehensive help system with contextual guidance

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Local Storage Limitations**: Browser storage quotas (typically 50MB-1GB), data migration challenges
- **PWA Compatibility**: Service worker support gaps, installation barriers on iOS
- **Performance**: Large photo datasets, complex analysis queries, memory constraints
- **Browser Differences**: IndexedDB implementation variations, camera API inconsistencies

### User Experience Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Complex feature set potentially overwhelming new users
- **Data Entry Burden**: Daily logging becoming tedious without proper UX optimization
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users uncomfortable with local photo storage despite encryption
- **Device Limitations**: Storage space constraints, processing power limitations on older devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple interface, reveal advanced features gradually through usage
- **Flexible Entry Modes**: Quick logging options, voice input, photo-based entry for difficult days
- **Clear Privacy Controls**: Transparent data handling explanations, one-click data deletion, local-only storage
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data structures, lazy loading, intelligent caching, background processing
