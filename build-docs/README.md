## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in build system with optimizations
- **Database**: Dexie.js wrapper over IndexedDB for local storage
- **State Management**: React Context API with custom hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **PWA**: Next.js PWA plugin with service workers

### Architecture Principles
- **Offline-First**: All features work without network connectivity
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works in all modern browsers
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second load times, smooth 60fps interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen reader support
- **Privacy**: Zero external data sharing without explicit user consent

### Development Standards
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with reusable, composable components
- **State Management**: Predictable, immutable updates with proper error boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- **Testing**: Unit tests for utilities, integration tests for components, E2E for critical flows
- **Documentation**: Inline JSDoc comments, component documentation, and implementation guides

## Success Criteria
