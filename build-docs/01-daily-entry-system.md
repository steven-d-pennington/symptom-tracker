# Daily Entry System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Daily Entry System is the core logging mechanism of the Autoimmune Symptom Tracker. It serves as the primary way users record their health status and is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate both quick entries on difficult days and comprehensive logging on better days.

## Core Requirements

### Entry Types
- **Quick Entry**: Minimal fields for rapid logging (pain, wellness, energy ratings)
- **Detailed Entry**: Full feature set for comprehensive tracking
- **Backdated Entry**: Ability to log for previous dates
- **Template Entry**: Duplicate previous day's entry as starting point

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface DailyEntry {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  timestamp: Date; // When entry was created/edited

  // Core Ratings (1-10 scale)
  overallWellness: number; // 1 = worst, 10 = best
  overallPain: number;
  energyLevel: number;
  moodLevel: number;
  sleepQuality: number;

  // Optional Extended Ratings
  inflammationLevel?: number;
  stressLevel?: number;

  // Associated Data
  symptoms: SymptomEntry[];
  triggers: TriggerEntry[];
  medications: MedicationEntry[];
  photos: PhotoReference[];
  notes?: string;

  // Metadata
  entryType: 'quick' | 'detailed' | 'backdated';
  isTemplate?: boolean;
  lastModified: Date;
}
```

## Component Architecture

### Main Components
1. **EntryForm** - Main form component with conditional rendering
2. **RatingSliders** - Reusable rating input component
3. **SymptomSelector** - Multi-select symptom tagging
4. **TriggerLogger** - Quick trigger addition
5. **MedicationTracker** - Daily medication logging
6. **PhotoCapture** - Camera integration
7. **EntryPreview** - Summary view before saving

### State Management
```typescript
interface EntryFormState {
  currentEntry: Partial<DailyEntry>;
  isQuickMode: boolean;
  showAdvanced: boolean;
  validationErrors: Record<string, string>;
  isSaving: boolean;
}
```

## User Flows

### Quick Entry Flow
1. User taps "Quick Log" button
2. Shows minimal form: 4 core ratings + optional notes
3. Auto-saves after 3 seconds of inactivity
4. Returns to dashboard with success confirmation

### Detailed Entry Flow
1. User selects "New Entry" → "Detailed"
2. Progressive disclosure: core ratings first
3. Optional sections revealed as user progresses
4. Save button with validation feedback

### Backdated Entry Flow
1. User navigates to past date in calendar
2. Taps "Add Entry" for that date
3. Form pre-fills with date context
4. Clear indication this is a backdated entry

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage
- **Primary Table**: `daily_entries`
- **Related Tables**: `entry_symptoms`, `entry_triggers`, `entry_medications`
- **Indexing**: Date-based indexing for fast calendar queries
- **Backup**: Automatic JSON export on save

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Advanced sections load only when needed
- **Debounced Saving**: Auto-save drafts every 5 seconds
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback, background sync
- **Memory Management**: Clear form state after successful save

### Validation Rules
```typescript
const entryValidation = {
  date: (value: Date) => value <= new Date(), // Can't log future dates
  ratings: (value: number) => value >= 1 && value <= 10,
  notes: (value: string) => value.length <= 2000, // Reasonable limit
  symptoms: (symptoms: SymptomEntry[]) => symptoms.length <= 20 // Prevent overload
};
```

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order follows logical flow: ratings → symptoms → triggers → save
- Enter key submits form
- Escape key cancels/closes modals

### Screen Reader Support
- Descriptive labels for all rating sliders
- Progress announcements ("Saving entry...")
- Error announcements with suggested fixes

### Motor Accessibility
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Swipe gestures for rating adjustments
- Voice input for notes field

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Real-time validation with inline feedback
- Clear error messages with actionable suggestions
- Highlight problematic fields

### Save Failures
- Offline queue for failed saves
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Data preservation during failures

### Data Conflicts
- Detect duplicate entries for same date
- Merge option for conflicting backdated entries
- Clear conflict resolution UI

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Form validation logic
- Data transformation functions
- State management updates

### Integration Tests
- Complete entry creation workflow
- Calendar integration
- Data persistence across sessions

### User Acceptance Tests
- Quick entry under 30 seconds
- Detailed entry workflow completion
- Backdated entry creation
- Form accessibility compliance

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Load Time**: Form renders in <1 second
- **Save Time**: Entry saves in <2 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB for form state
- **Bundle Size**: Core form <100KB gzipped

### User Experience Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: >90% of started entries completed
- **Error Rate**: <5% of submissions have validation errors
- **Usage Frequency**: Average 5+ entries per week for active users

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Voice Input**: Dictation for notes on difficult days
- **Photo Templates**: Quick photo capture with auto-tagging
- **Location Context**: GPS-based trigger suggestions
- **Pattern Learning**: Auto-suggest based on historical entries

### Phase 3 Features
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill based on time of day/week patterns
- **Entry Templates**: Save and reuse custom entry formats
- **Collaborative Entries**: Caregiver assistance mode
- **Health Integration**: Import from wearables/devices
